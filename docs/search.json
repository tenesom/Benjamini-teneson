    "text": "Potential Pupil to Unfit students\nThe most critical question is: During a serious self-evaluation, which period would you consider yourself to be the best product? Is it when you achieved a Division 1.3 in your form six examinations or when you obtained a GPA of 3.1 in university? If I am honest with myself, the truth is that upon completing advanced education, I possessed enough knowledge to teach secondary level subjects without constantly referring to books. However, after finishing university, the situation may be different.\n\n\nPupils in Tanzania undergo their education under the guidance of teachers, as well as guardians such as matrons and patrons in certain environments. Their educational journey typically spans from standard one to form six, which comprises the formal system in the country. This period is known as the Primary and Secondary level. During this stage, the Ministry of Education prepares the syllabus and conducts examinations.\nNational exams are administered at various stages throughout the academic years to assess the pupils’ progress. These exams serve as a means for identifying the most accomplished students within the national academic system. In the Primary and Secondary level, teachers are responsible for instructing the pupils based on the provided syllabus, while the National Examinations Council of Tanzania (NECTA) plays a role in testing the students and selecting the top achievers according to national academic standards.\nIn the primary and secondary stages, the roles of the trainer (teacher) and the examiner (Necta) are distinct. The primary responsibility of the teacher is to impart knowledge based on the syllabus, while Necta is responsible for evaluating the quality of the students’ performance. Thus, the qualification of a pupil is not determined solely by the teacher’s assessment.\n\nThis testing process not only assesses the pupil’s abilities but also evaluates the overall quality of school performance and the efforts of both teachers and students. The examination is typically based on the standards set by the public education system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublic standard.\nAfter completing the final national exam in form six, pupils transition into the university education system, where they become students. At this stage, students pursue various programs based on their specialization. The duration of these programs varies, with some lasting three years, others four years, and certain faculties requiring five years of study. The societal expectation for graduates is clear and straightforward: they should possess the skills and knowledge necessary to address challenges in society.\n\n\n\nuniversity standard.\nIn the university stage, the roles of the trainer and the examiner often merge, with the lecturer being responsible for both teaching and evaluating the students. This implies that the qualification of a student is determined by the standards set by the lecturer. Therefore, the competence and effectiveness of the lecturer play a crucial role in shaping the competence of the student. If the lecturer is highly competent, the students are more likely to acquire the necessary knowledge and skills.\n\n\n\nHowever, it is important to note that this system also has the potential to produce graduates who may be considered incompetent or unfit to address not only public challenges but also their own personal challenges. If the lecturer is not adequately skilled or fails to effectively impart knowledge to the students, it can result in graduates who lack the necessary competencies. These graduates may struggle to apply their education in practical situations and may not meet the expectations of society.\nThe exact failure rates for postgraduate programs such as law school, CPA programs, and other related qualifications can vary depending on several factors, including the specific program, institution, and cohort of students. However, it is worth noting that these programs often have rigorous standards and expectations.\nWhile it is difficult to provide specific statistics on student failure rates in these programs without more specific information, it is important to recognize that postgraduate programs often have high standards and demand significant dedication, effort, and mastery of the subject matter. Success in these programs typically requires a strong commitment to studying, preparation, and meeting the academic requirements set by the program.\n\nIs university a brain washer or cultivator?.\n\n\nAccording to Kishimba, an MP, he expressed his views on the current education system, stating that it is illogical to separate parents from their children for 20 years, only to provide them with a certificate at the end and expect them to find a job. He argued that this approach fails to equip individuals with practical skills necessary for everyday life, such as basic household tasks. Consequently, he questioned how these individuals can effectively manage in the real world.\nIn his further remarks, Kishimba claimed that the most productive individuals in today’s society are those who dropped out of school at Standard Seven, followed by those who left after completing Form Four or Form Six. He emphasized that these individuals possess practical skills that are valued within their community, including the ability to engage in farming. However, he labeled university graduates as “Viazi vilivyokataa kuiva,” a metaphorical expression implying that they are incapable of contributing meaningfully to the community.Kishimba suggests that universities should prioritize seeking job opportunities before admitting students.\n\nHis proposal entails a system where students are guaranteed employment upon completing their studies after paying their school fees.\n\n\n\nIt is important to note that these are the views expressed by Kishimba and may not reflect the opinions or beliefs of others or the broader perspective on education and the value of different educational levels.\nWhile this idea may seem appealing on the surface, it presents some challenges and considerations. Here are a few points to ponder: Education is not solely about securing a job; it is also about acquiring knowledge, critical thinking skills, and personal growth. Universities play a vital role in equipping students with a broad range of skills that can be applied across various industries and careers. While the intent behind Kishimba’s suggestion may be to address the issue of employability, a more holistic approach to education and career development would involve a combination of academic knowledge, practical skills, experiential learning, and career support services.\n\n\nQuicky approach.\nIt is suggested that a national standard for evaluating university students and lecturers should be established. This evaluation process, in the form of exams, would be created by a dedicated board or council responsible for testing all university students upon completing their courses. The purpose of this standardized examination is to ensure that both lecturers and students fulfill their responsibilities, knowing that there will be a national qualifying exam at the end. The exam would assess not only the material taught but also the content outlined in the respective course programs, thus ensuring that students meet the national academic standards.\nBy implementing such a system, the aim is to bring uniformity and accountability to the evaluation process across universities. It would provide a consistent benchmark against which students and lecturers can be assessed, reinforcing the importance of covering the necessary curriculum and meeting the expected learning outcomes outlined in the course programs.\nIt is important to note that the implementation of a national evaluation system should consider factors such as the diversity of university programs, different teaching methods, and the need for flexibility in adapting to emerging educational needs. Additionally, ensuring the fairness, transparency, and reliability of the evaluation process would be crucial in maintaining the credibility and effectiveness of the system.\n\n\nUniversal Medical Programs.\n\n\nThe current medical programs in universities can serve as a potential model for ongoing methods in other professional programs. These medical programs have a structured approach that can be referenced for reforming other university programs. In a medical doctor’s training, the students typically undergo a comprehensive curriculum that spans several years. The program typically consists of three years of theoretical classroom learning, followed by two years of clinical field experience, and culminates in a one-year internship.\n\nDuring the initial three years, students acquire theoretical knowledge through classroom lectures and study materials. This period allows them to build a strong foundation of medical concepts and principles. The subsequent two years focus on clinical field experience, where students directly interact with patients under the supervision of clinical mentors. This hands-on experience provides them with practical exposure, enabling them to apply their knowledge in real-world medical scenarios.\n\n\nFinally, students complete a one-year internship, during which they practice under a provisional license. This stage serves as a transitional period where students gain valuable experience in managing healthcare settings and working directly with patients, albeit with some supervision. Successful completion of the internship allows students to obtain a full practicing license, qualifying them for employment as medical professionals.\n\n\nThis structured progression of theoretical learning, clinical experience, and internship in medical programs ensures that students acquire both theoretical knowledge and practical skills necessary for their profession. It also provides a gradual transition from a supervised learning environment to independent practice. While other professional programs may have different requirements and specific needs, the medical program’s emphasis on a combination of theory, practical experience, and internship can serve as a reference for the reform of similar programs. Adapting and implementing elements of this model may help ensure that graduates are well-prepared for their chosen fields and possess the necessary skills and competencies to excel in their professional careers.\n\nIt is generally recognized that the health department’s workers exhibit a high level of competence, despite the challenges they face in their working environments. This professional class stands out as one of the few where individuals graduate from college with the ability to effectively perform their professional skills. It is also worth noting that competence in professional skills is not exclusive to the healthcare sector. There are various other professions where individuals graduate with the necessary abilities to perform their professional duties effectively. The level of competence may vary depending on the specific field, the quality of education and training, and individual commitment to professional growth.\n\n\n\n\nPotential Method.\nIt is crucial for universities to prioritize the selection and training of competent lecturers to ensure the quality of education provided. Additionally, a well-designed curriculum, practical experiences, and opportunities for critical thinking can contribute to producing graduates who are better equipped to tackle various challenges in society. By separating the roles of the trainer and examiner, it establishes a system where the examiner can assess the students’ understanding and application of the material without bias. The emphasis is placed on the students’ ability to grasp the concepts and meet the requirements of the program rather than personal relationships or subjective factors.\n\n\nMy view point.\n\n\nWhile I acknowledge the importance of universities, I believe that true progress can be achieved when there is complete accountability throughout the education system. This accountability should extend to both the lecturers who impart knowledge to the students and the examination bodies that assess their performance. Without such accountability, the quality of education will always be determined by individual standards rather than meeting the collective academic expectations.\nInstead of solely blaming the university itself, it is essential to address the underlying factors that influence its functioning. Just as a windmill moves in the direction of the wind, we must tackle the root causes to bring about meaningful change. By adopting the rigorous standards applied in medical programs and applying them to all courses, we can ensure that graduates possess the necessary skills and abilities to tackle the challenges of the present and future.\nIn doing so, can strive for a system that emphasizes\n\n\n\n\nboth individual growth and community expectations, resulting in graduates who meet the highest standards of academic achievement while being well-equipped to address the pressing issues of our time."

    "section": "",
    "text": "A law system is a huge and complex system to understand if not well explained, the system is often well understood by the few individual privileged to serve it. The systems deffer from one place to another (One country to another), but the system is basically built under the principles of common laws. This is to say, many system share some similarities and many values. In this session we shall discuss the common law system basically, we shall focus on Tanzania Law and governance system, we shall also look at the Constitution and law making bodies together with their roll. This will help many to simplify the division of power and duties of the government’s arms.\n\n\nTanzania Governance system.\nIt is usually to be told that in Tanzania the governance system act on the principle of Division of Power, this is to say, the Government is divided in three Arms. Executive, Legislature, Judiciary. These are the arms recognized by the Country’s Constitution of 1977. The constitution further provides general orders. which address the duty and mandate of each arm. Here we shall focus on general provisions.\n\n\nGeneral concept.\nThe concept is usually one and the same, that Avery arm has its main roll, and none of it should interfere the other. It is indeed a theory of how to explain the separation of power, but in reality the reverse is the case, all the government’s arms are somewhere connected direct with each other as well as depend on each other practical. That each arm should not practice or act the duties of other arm, therefor to avoid the conflict of the law, then each arm shall only execute its mandate in accordance with the Constitution. But practically it is total different, because we shall see how each arm operate and where one arm perform the duty of the other accordance with the laws and even the constitution it self.\nRolls of the government’s Arms……\n\nExecutive to execute the laws.\nLegislature to Make the Laws.\nJudiciary to Interpreter the laws.\n\n\n\nLegislature.\nThe law makers, Government’s Adviser and Executive’s Supervisor.\nWe are all familiar with legislature, because this class is formed by individuals (Politicians), this class constitutionally is formed by political parties and through general election. Legislature is formed by two parts, The President and all members of parliament.\n\n\nLeaders of the Legislature\n\nSpeaker of National Assembly, is elected my members but he/she required to be an elected member of parliament.\nDeputy Speaker, who is elected by members but he/she is not obliged to be a member of parliament.\nParliament Secretary, who is appointed by a President and\nParliament’s Chairperson (s).\n\nAlso the Parliament has its traditional and standing orders, which lead it to conduct its daily mandate, the leadership of the parliament is in accordance with the Tanzania constitution of 1977. And in standing orders we find other leaders of the parliament such as parliament chairperson (s), who are elected by members of the parliament and leaders of the committees, who are appointed by Speaker of the national Assembly.\nAmong the members of the parliament is where we also get Government’s\n\nPrime Minister,\nMinisters and\nDeputy Ministers,\n\nthis is in accordance with the Tanzania Constitution of 1977. The Prime Minister, ministers and deputy ministers are appointed by the President, who is both the part of parliament and the head of government, they serve as top leaders in ministries under an executive arm. The president being the part of parliament, means the survival of the parliament is the survival of the president, so in order the Presidency to function it must first open the parliament, as well as the presidency to cease it must cease the parliament. This is what it called SEMI PRESIDENCIAL SYSTEM, (when the parliament cease the President also cease).\n\n\nPolicy to laws.\nThe parliament make laws by discussing and passing the bills by vote of one third of all attended members of parliament, the bills are prepared by the central government and brought to the parliament by a minister or any member of the parliament. After the bills are passed, require the approval of the President to become a Laws. Therefor when we say the Parliament makes Laws, simply means The whole members of the parliament and the President, together they make Laws. The laws made by the parliament are called statutes. Statutes (Written Laws). These are the main laws in the land, after the Constitution which is the Supreme Law.\n\n\nThe president as a part of parliament.\nPresident as a part of the parliament doesn’t means he is supposed to attend all the sessions of the parliament, because the prime minister act as the leader of the government’s activities in the parliament. But we normally see the president participate as a part of parliament in two occasion, During the open and the close of the parliament’s conferences, and During the approval of the bills to laws, in these two occasion is when the president participate and act as a part of the parliament.\n\n\nExecutive.\nThe Presidency and The law executors.\nMany are familiar with the word “Government”, but this is what it called the Executive, this class is also famous, because it is also made up by political class, it is consist of Country’s, President, Vice President and Prime Minister. President is the head of executive with the following functions.\n\n\nFunctions of the President.\n\nHead of the State.\nHead of the Government.\nCommander in chief of the armed forces.\n\nThe President act upon those tree mentioned functions, this means, there is a time when the President performs the duties of State, then there is time when the President performs duties of the Government and also the duties of Commander in chief. Through these functions which are provided under the 1977 Constitution of Tanzania, the executive execute its constitutional mandate. aws made by Executives are Regulations, bylaws, Instruments and Policy\nThe cabinet makes Instruments for the Ministries, Ministries make Regulations for its organs, and organs make policy and and Bylaws. This is in accordance with the provision under 1977 constitution where the Parliament delegates some of its power to the Government to act on its behalf in some matters, and on the state of emergency. At the end page I’ve shown through flowchart on how these mentioned laws operate. These laws are minor to those of the parliaments, so if those regulations conflicts with the written law, then it must be taken to the parliament for amendment. And the parliament may amend it or make some suggestions to amend or order the government to reverse it.\n\n\nJudiciary.\nThe Court and The Laws Interpreters.\nJudiciary is one of the Government’s arm, a Judiciary is headed by His Lordship The Chief Justice. Judiciary legality is under the Tanzania Constitution of 1977. and judicial system is consist of Chief Justice. Justices, Magistrates, Lawyers, Court’s Clerks and other administrators. The head of the judiciary is the Chief justice of Tanzania, who is constitutionally appointed by the President of Tanzania. And once appointed can never be removed, until the retirement.\nIn an exercise of their mandate Judiciary enjoys full liberty and SUO MORTU. Which is the power to intervene any matter with the public interest, also Judiciary is the last decider of all state affairs, simply the judgement of the court is the last decision.\n\n\n\nCourt System.**\n\nPrimary court. (with limited jurisdiction)\nDistrict Court. (with limited jurisdiction)\nResident Magistrate Court. (with limited jurisdiction)\nHigh Courts. (with no jurisdiction)\nCourt of appeal. (with no jurisdiction)\n\nThe Laws interpreted/matters decided by Courts are known as Court’s Rulings/Judgments, Court’s Orders\nThen these rulings/Judgement are taken back to the Law school, or education institutes for the purpose of case study, simply they are known as Case Laws (Precedents). These Laws when ruled by a Higher Court, then are usually the binding laws to the subordinates court’s decisions. Also When matter taken to court and it involves one/both of the arms, Courts have power to gives Orders to be executed by both The parliament and Executive.\n\n\nThe current system of Law making and its Execution.\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TB\n  A[(The &lt;/br&gt; Republic)] --&gt; B{The &lt;/br&gt; Constitution}\n  B --&gt; C[Legislature]\n  B --&gt; D[Executive]\n  B --&gt; E[Judiciary]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TB\n  C[Legislature] --&gt; D[Executive]\n  D -- Bill--&gt; C\n  C --&gt; E{Judiciary's &lt;/br&gt; Decisions}\n  D[Executive's &lt;/br&gt; Instruments] --&gt; F(Ministry's &lt;/br&gt; Regulations and &lt;/br&gt; Rules )\n  F --&gt; G(Ministry's Organs, &lt;/br&gt; Institutes and &lt;/br&gt; Local Governments)\n  G -- Policy --&gt; D\n  G -- Bylaws and guide lines --&gt; A[(The &lt;/br&gt; Republic)]\n  E{Judiciary's &lt;/br&gt; Decisions} -- Rules and Orders --&gt; A[(The &lt;/br&gt; Republic &lt;/br&gt;)]\n  E -- Orders --&gt; C[Legislature's &lt;/br&gt; Statutes]\n  E -- Orders --&gt; D\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Summary.\nThe concept that Legislature is the only arm that makes Laws, is practically not applicable in common law system, because during the execution, other arms also make some laws to execute both the Mother law as well as other written laws. Therefor these are the Executable Laws made under the provision of the constitution of Tanzania of 1977. The legislature makes Laws called Statutes/Written Laws. The Executive makes Laws called Instruments, Regulations and Bylaws. The Judiciary makes Laws called Precedents/Case Laws and Rules."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This post is showing the meaning of Jurisdiction, attached with Court’s judgement as reference, it’s useful in legal matters in Tanzania.\n\n\nJURISDICTION\nIt is fundamental issue that the Court may raise suo motu whenever appropriate. Hulsbury’s Laws of England, 4th Edition, Reissue Vol. 10, para. 314, defines jurisdiction as follows:\n“By ’jurisdiction: is meant the authority which a court has to decide matters that are litigated before it or to take cognizance of matters presented in a formal way for its decision. The limits of this authority are imposed by the statute, charter or commission under which the court is constituted, and may be extended or restricted by similar means”.\nThe case of Bestcom Company Ltd vs. Jacob Mtalitinya t/a IT Farm, High Court of Tanzania at Dar es Salaam Civil Case No. 160 of 2012 (unreported) has explained the issues of pecuniary jurisdiction in deep. Pecuniary jurisdiction of the High Court of Tanzania It starts where pecuniary jurisdiction of the District Courts and Resident Magistrate’s Courts in respect of movable properties and immovable properties are limited and above indefinitely.\nPecuniary jurisdiction of the District Courts and Resident Magistrate’s Courts Section 22 of the Written Laws (Miscellaneous Amendments) Act, No. 3 of 2016 establishes the pecuniary jurisdiction of the Primary Courts in respect of movable properties is limited to Tshs. 200 Million while for immovable properties is limited to Tshs. 300 Million.\n\n\nPecuniary jurisdiction of the Primary Courts Section 20 of the Written Laws (Miscellaneous Amendments) Act, No. 3 of 2016 establishes the pecuniary jurisdiction of the Primary Courts in respect of movable properties is limited to Tshs. 30 Million while for immovable properties is limited to Tshs. 50 Million.\n\n\nThe Court of Appeal in Tanzania Friendship Textile Mill vs. Our Lady of the Usambara Sisters [2006] TLR 70 held that the High Court did not have jurisdiction to determine civil suits in which the quantum of damages sought fell within the pecuniary jurisdiction of District Courts and Courts of Resident Magistrates.\n\n\n\n\n\nSubject matter jurisdiction\nAll land cases now fall under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Land and Housing Tribunals and the Land Division of the High Court, established under the Land Disputes Courts Act [CAP. 216 R.E. 2002].\n“commercial case” is defined under Section 2 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act [CAP. 11 R.E. 2002] means a civil case involving a matter considered to be of commercial significance including but not limited to-\n\n\n(i) the formation of business or commercial organization;\n(ii) the governance of a business or commercial organization;\n(iii) the contractual relationship of a business or commercial organization with other bodies or persons outside it;\n(iv) the liability of a commercial or business organization or its officials arising out of its commercial or business activities;\n(v) the liabilities of a commercial or business person arising out of that person’s commercial or business activities;\n(vi) the restructuring or payment of commercial debts by or to business or commercial organization or person;\n\n(vii) the winding up or bankruptcy of a commercial or business organization or person;\n(viii) the enforcement of commercial arbitration award;\n(ix) the enforcement of awards of a regional court or tribunal of competent jurisdiction made in accordance with a Treaty or Mutual Assistance arrangement to which the United Republic is a signatory and which forms part of the law of the United Republic;\n(x) admiralty proceedings; and\n(xi) arbitration proceedings.\n\n\n\nWriting on such rules in common law jurisdictions, Elmer Driedger, in his Construction of Statutes (Toronto: Butterworths, 1983, p. 1), observes:\n“The notion has long prevailed that three different rules or approaches may be employed in ascertaining the meaning of a statute. First, there is said to be the ‘purpose’ approach or ‘mischief rule’ Then there is said to be the ***‘literal’ approach or ‘plain meaning’ rule. Finally there is what is called the ‘golden rule’.”\n\n\nIn Renada Minerals Corporation vs. Consolidated Holding Corporation & Anor, High Court of Tanzania at Arusha, Civil Case No. 52 of 1999 (unreported). In that case, Rutakangwa, J. (as he then was), held that section 13 of the CPC is a rule of procedure and not of jurisdiction and, as such, cannot be construed to take away the jurisdiction of this court to entertain matters simply because it requires suits to be instituted in the lowest court competent to try it. His Lordship stated as follows (after citing with approval Mulla on The Code of Civil Procedure, 16th edition):\n\n\nIt is my holding therefore, that s. 13 of the CPC 1966 does not oust the jurisdiction of this court in respect of suits of this nature which by their monetary value ought to be commenced in the district or even in the primary courts. If by sheer inadvertence or for the sake of convenience a plaintiff institutes a suit of this nature which by virtue of s. 13 of the CPC 1966 as a matter of procedure and policy ought to have been instituted in one of the two subordinate courts, this court, has the option of either returning the\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nplaint to the plaintiff under Order VII rule 10 of the CPC 1966 or trying and determining the same.” [emphasis mine]\n\n\nThe decision of the Court of Appeal in Tanzania China Friendship Textile Mill vs. Our Lady of the Usambara Sisters [2006] held that, the High Court did not have jurisdiction to determine civil suits in which the quantum for damages sought fell within the pecuniary jurisdiction of District Courts and Courts of Resident Magistrates. The effect of that decision is to exclude the option of applying Order VII rule 10 of the CPC, which would have allowed this court to either try the case itself, or return the plaint to the plaintiff for filing in a registry of a competent subordinate court. The only remaining option, following Usambara Sisters, is to strike out the suit.\nRelated Posts:"

    "text": "R without data is just an Application. So to enjoy R programming then you need to deal with data. So in most cases you will be given data from outsource. And most of outsource data are not tidy, therefor you will need to tidy them before manipulation. Then you have to save them in your computer, tidy them, then model them, then share your findings. In R we use different approach when it comes to data manipulation, different from other languages, so once given data, the first thing to understand is its type.\nThe data below are not in tidy form, therefor we have to tidy them firstly. We will not write every step of the process because i believe you have already got the concept from the last lesson, but you can see the function in the chunk, we have equated our data by giving it a name raw. And followed by the name of extension, then my local directory and the name of the data.\n\n\n\n\n\nrequire(tidyverse)\n\nLoading required package: tidyverse\n\n\n-- Attaching core tidyverse packages ------------------------ tidyverse 2.0.0 --\nv dplyr     1.1.1     v readr     2.1.4\nv forcats   1.0.0     v stringr   1.5.0\nv ggplot2   3.4.2     v tibble    3.2.1\nv lubridate 1.9.2     v tidyr     1.3.0\nv purrr     1.0.1     \n-- Conflicts ------------------------------------------ tidyverse_conflicts() --\nx dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\nx dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\ni Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\nrequire(lubridate)\nrequire(dplyr)\nrequire(lubridate)\nrequire(readxl)\n\nLoading required package: readxl\n\nrequire(janitor)\n\nLoading required package: janitor\n\nAttaching package: 'janitor'\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    chisq.test, fisher.test\n\nrequire(magrittr)\n\nLoading required package: magrittr\n\nAttaching package: 'magrittr'\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:purrr':\n\n    set_names\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:tidyr':\n\n    extract\n\nrequire(readr)\nrequire(readxl)\n\n\nHow to tidy data 1st Example.\nworld population data before tidying.\n\npopul=read.csv(\"e:/MY_STAFFS/Minning__Folder/Blogs/teneson/posts/R-2nd-leson/The world population data/world_population.csv\")\n\nworld population data after tidying.\n\npopul=read.csv(\"e:/MY_STAFFS/Minning__Folder/Blogs/teneson/posts/R-2nd-leson/The world population data/world_population.csv\") %&gt;%\n clean_names() %&gt;% \n  select(-c(2,4)) %&gt;% \n pivot_longer(cols = 4:11, names_to = \"years\", values_to = \"populations\") %&gt;% \n mutate(years = replace(years, years == \"x2000_population\",2000), \n        years = replace(years, years == \"x2010_population\",2010),\n        years = replace(years, years == \"x2015_population\",2015),\n        years = replace(years, years == \"x2020_population\",2020),\n        years = replace(years, years == \"x2022_population\",2022),\n        years = replace(years, years == \"x1990_population\",1990),\n        years = replace(years, years == \"x1980_population\",1980), \n        years = replace(years, years == \"x1970_population\",1970)) %&gt;% \n  rename(area.km.sq = area_km_a2) %&gt;% \n  rename(dens.km.sq = density_per_km_a2) %&gt;% \n  rename(percentage = world_population_percentage) %&gt;% \n  rename(growth.rate = growth_rate)\n\nHow to save tidy data.\n\npopul %&gt;% write.csv(\"clean_world_population.csv\")\n\nThe data above show the raw data given from the original source which was collected and filed in csv extension, therefor in R programming language, you can’t work with data the same were collected in other orders. So as we have seen in above procedures, you will need to tidy them to be supported in R. and the above procedures are some of the few ways to deal with messy data you might come across with.\n\n\nHow to tidy data 2nd example.\n\nraw = read_excel(\"e:/MY_STAFFS/Minning__Folder/Blogs/teneson/posts/R-2nd-leson/Tamisemi/Primary Enrolment by Age and Sex,2021.xls\")\n\nSo step 2, we are going to equate our data again and rename column, then remove column 1,28 and 29, because they provide no necessary information therefor we shall remain with 26 column. Now our data is called moja.We shall use function “clean names” of “Janitor package”.\n\nmoja = raw %&gt;% clean_names() %&gt;% select(-c(1,28,29))\n\nNow let’s rename our 7 to 26 column because they are not well arranged, as we can see age and gender are both in same column, in order to put it easier for analysis, then we must separate them. But yet the data frame shows that ages of kids are not specified, some are actual and some are unspecific, therefore we are going to predict some values that can help in analysis, where age is below 6 we shall put 5, and where is above 13 we shall put 14, then we will specify in detail in an output. Here we shall use pivot function of janitor package which is in tidyverse package.\n\nmbili = moja %&gt;% pivot_longer(names_to = \"kids\", values_to = \"number\", cols = 7:26) %&gt;% \n  mutate(gender = c(\"boys\", \"girls\") %&gt;% rep(times = 185460),\n         age = seq(5, 14, 1) %&gt;% rep(each = 2) %&gt;% rep(times = 18546)) \n\nNow we deselect kids column and registration number column.\n\ntatu = mbili %&gt;% select(-c(5,7))\n\n\n\nR Studio auto generated data.\nWe can also get data from R studio itself, Now lets jump strait to Rstudio on computer and see how you can get data, and see how to tidy data and share the results.\nTemperature Data.\n\nsample1 = rnorm(n = 10, mean = 26, sd = 2) %&gt;% as_tibble() %&gt;% mutate(sample = \"samp1\")\n\nsample2 = rnorm(n = 20, mean = 26, sd = 2) %&gt;% as_tibble() %&gt;% mutate(sample = \"samp2\")\n\nsample3 = rnorm(n = 30, mean = 26, sd = 2) %&gt;% as_tibble() %&gt;% mutate(sample = \"samp3\")\n\nsample4 = rnorm(n = 40, mean = 26, sd = 2) %&gt;% as_tibble() %&gt;% mutate(sample = \"samp4\")\n\nsample5 = rnorm(n = 50, mean = 26, sd = 2) %&gt;% as_tibble() %&gt;% mutate(sample = \"samp5\")\n\n\nBind rows and columns.\nHow to bind different samples to a one data set, you either combine rows or columns. We use the function bind_rows/bind_col.\n\ndata.sample = bind_rows(sample1,\n                        sample2,\n                        sample3,\n                        sample4,\n                        sample5)\n\nWe have created different sample size and bind five samples together, we have used the function binding_rows to bind. We have named them (data.sample). But these data are auto-generated from the system, so they change from time to time as you run your chunk. Therefor in order to permanently use them without changes, then you’ll need to save them in your directory.\n\n\n\nHOW TO SAVE AUTO GENERATED DATA TO YOUR COMPUTER.\nWhen you import data into R, we use the function read_. But to save generated data from the system to local directory we apply the function write_, and you may save it in whatever extension you often use. Here under is the function plus application to save the data generated from the system in local directory. Our new data will be called datasample. We put a comment (#) so that a chunk not to run. still it show how it’s applicable in case you want to save your data.\n\n#data.sample %&gt;% write_csv(\"datasample.csv\")\n\nNow that our data are saved in our local directory, then to use it we must import in R. In importation we shall equate it as supa.\n\nsupa = read_csv(\"datasample.csv\")\n\nRows: 150 Columns: 2\n-- Column specification --------------------------------------------------------\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (1): sample\ndbl (1): value\n\ni Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\ni Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\n\n\n\nsupa %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x = value, colour = sample, fill = sample))+\n  geom_density(alpha = 0.1)+\n  theme_bw()+theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank())+\n  theme(panel.grid.minor = element_blank())+\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")+theme(axis.text.x = element_text(colour = \"darkblue\", size = 10),axis.text.y = element_text(colour = \"darkblue\", size = 10),axis.title = element_text(colour = \"darkblue\", size = 13),legend.text = element_text(colour = \"darkblue\"),legend.title = element_text(colour = \"darkblue\", size = 10))\n\n\n\n\nabove figure show all sample’s result together, it is easier to present samples result in one figure, but the main purpose is to be understandable. Therefor it may be a bit harder for a viewer to understand the above figure. So in such situation we can opt to present our figure in separate samples.\n\n\nsupa %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = value, colour = sample, fill =sample))+\n  geom_density(alpha = 0.4)+ theme_bw()+\n  theme(legend.background = element_blank())+\n  facet_wrap(~sample)+\n  theme(legend.position = c(0.8,0.25),panel.grid = element_line(colour = \"white\"),axis.title = element_text(colour = \"darkblue\", size =13),axis.text = element_text(colour = \"darkblue\", size = 10),strip.background = element_rect(fill = \"lightblue\"),strip.text.x = element_text(colour = \"darkblue\", size = 10),legend.text = element_text(colour = \"darkblue\", size = 10),legend.title = element_text(colour = \"darkblue\"))\n\n\n\n\nThe above figure samples now are clearly observed. Also proves the concept that “you are in good position to get right result when you have enough sample”. Therefor you will need to consider the sample size before rushing to analysis.\n\n\n\n\nR Studio AUTO GENERATED DATA 2.\n\ntrial = iris %&gt;% \n  as_tibble() %&gt;% \n  janitor::clean_names() \n\n\n\n\ntrial %$% max(sepal_length, na.rm = TRUE) \n\n[1] 7.9\n\n\n\n\ntrial %$% min(sepal_length, na.rm = TRUE) \n\n[1] 4.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntrial %$% median(sepal_length, na.rm = TRUE) \n\n[1] 5.8\n\n\n\n\ntrial %$% mean(sepal_length, na.rm = TRUE) \n\n[1] 5.843333\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntrial.longer = iris %&gt;% \n  as_tibble() %&gt;% \n  janitor::clean_names() %&gt;% \n  pivot_longer(names_to = \"variable\", values_to = \"value\", cols = 1:4)\n\n\n\ntrial.longer %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x = species, y = value, color = variable)) +\n  geom_boxplot()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntrial.longer %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x = species, y = value, fill = variable)) +\n  geom_boxplot()\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntrial.longer %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x = species, y = value, fill = variable)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  facet_wrap(~variable)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntrial.longer %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x = species, y = value, fill = variable)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  facet_wrap(~variable, scales = \"free_y\") +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank(),\n        panel.grid.major = element_line(linetype = \"dashed\", colour = \"grey90\"),\n        axis.text = element_text(colour = \"black\", size = 10),\n        axis.title = element_text(colour = \"black\", size = 11),\n        legend.background = element_rect(colour = \"black\", fill = NA),\n        legend.text = element_text(colour = \"black\", size = 10),\n        strip.background = element_rect(fill = NA),\n        strip.text = element_text(colour = \"black\", size = 10)) +\n  labs(x = \"Species\", y = \"Length (cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntrial.longer %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x = species, y = value, fill = variable)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  facet_wrap(~variable, scales = \"free_y\") +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank(),\n        panel.grid.major = element_line(linetype = \"dashed\", colour = \"grey90\"),\n        axis.text = element_text(colour = \"black\", size = 10),\n        axis.title = element_text(colour = \"black\", size = 11),\n        legend.position = \"none\",\n        strip.background = element_rect(fill = \"NA\"),\n        strip.text = element_text(colour = \"black\", size = 10)) +\n  labs(x = \"Species\", y = \"Length (cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated pots"

    "section": "",
    "text": "INTRODUCTION.\n\n\nIt’s possible that you’re aware of the R programming language and have come across useful tips for improving your R experience. However, I’d like to introduce another intriguing aspect of R. For beginners delving into R, there’s a delightful feature that allows you to effortlessly create a single document within the R editor, which can then be shared in various formats like PDF, Word, or HTML. This isn’t just an imagination. it’s the reality of using R. In fact, the very post you’re currently reading was generated using R. R is a truly remarkable tool that empowers users with coding skills, enhances writing abilities, facilitates the generation of diverse document formats.Promotes standardization and visualization, strengthens data analysis skills, expands statistical knowledge, and offers a multitude of other advantages for individuals working with data and research.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR Mentor\nBy having a mentor, you can benefit from their expertise, ask questions, and receive direct assistance tailored to your specific needs. They can help you understand complex concepts, provide examples and exercises, and ensure that you grasp the fundamental principles of R effectively. While books and online content are excellent resources for expanding your knowledge, having a mentor complements those resources by providing personalized guidance and support. It creates a dynamic learning environment where you can actively engage with someone experienced in R, fostering a deeper understanding and faster progress.\nIn conclusion, while reading books and searching online resources are valuable components of learning R,for beginners, having a mentor can offer significant advantages. They can provide individualized guidance, help you navigate challenges, and accelerate your learning journey. So, consider seeking a mentor who can dedicate time and effort to support you as you delve into the intricacies of R programming.\n\n\nRStudio INSTALATION & MODERN R.\nTo start your journey with the R programming language, the first step is to install R and RStudio on your computer. R is the programming language itself, while RStudio provides a comprehensive working environment that enhances your R experience.\nHere’s a breakdown of what R and RStudio are:\nR is a programming language and software environment designed for statistical computing and graphics. It provides a wide range of statistical and graphical techniques and is widely used in various fields such as data analysis, research, and machine learning.\nRStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R. It provides a user-friendly interface with powerful tools and features that streamline your coding workflow. RStudio offers a code editor, console, data viewer, and a variety of helpful features like code completion, debugging tools, and project management.\nOnce you have installed R and RStudio, you’ll need to install packages that support the functionality of R and RStudio. Packages in R are collections of functions, data, and documentation that extend the capabilities of the base R system. These packages provide additional functions that are necessary for performing various tasks in your daily coding activities.\nTo download R, you can visit the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) website. CRAN is a network of mirror servers worldwide that distribute R and R packages. It’s recommended to use the cloud mirror, which automatically selects the appropriate mirror for you. You can access it at https://cloud.r-project.org.\nIt’s worth noting that a new major version of R is released annually, with minor releases occurring 2-3 times a year. It’s generally recommended to update R regularly to benefit from the latest features and improvements. Upgrading R can sometimes require reinstalling your packages, which may take some effort, particularly for major version upgrades. However, it’s advisable to keep your R installation up to date to ensure compatibility and access to the latest functionalities.\nBy installing R, setting up RStudio, and regularly updating your software, you’ll be well-equipped to begin your R programming journey and explore the vast possibilities the language has to offer.\n\n\nR Package installation.\nIn R, packages are fundamental in R, and installing the necessary packages is crucial for expanding the capabilities of your R environment. One highly popular and powerful package ecosystem in R is called the “tidyverse”. The tidyverse is a collection of packages that work together seamlessly to provide a cohesive and efficient workflow for data entry, manipulation, modeling, visualization, and sharing insights derived from data analysis. Some of the key packages within the tidyverse include dplyr for data manipulation, ggplot2 for data visualization, tidyr for data tidying, readr for data import, and many more.\nTo install the tidyverse package, you can use the following command in R:\n                         [ install.packages(\"tidyverse\") ]\n\n\nINTRODUCTION TO DATA SCIENCE IN R PROGRAMME.\nData science is a huge field, and there’s no way you can master it by reading a single book, so as i explained above it is more helpful if you get a mentor to lead you through obstacles. Also is an exciting knowledge that allows you to turn raw data into understanding, insight, and knowledge. The goal of R for Data Science is to help you to learn the most important tools in R that will allow you to do data science.\n\n\nData importation\nImporting data into R is an essential step in performing data analysis. Data can be stored in various formats such as files (e.g., CSV, Excel), databases, or web APIs, and loading it into R allows you to manipulate, analyze, and visualize the data. To import data into R, you typically use functions or packages specifically designed for each data source or format.\n\n\nTyding\n\n\nOnce you’ve imported your data, it is required to tidy your data. Tidying your data means storing it in a consistent form that matches the semantics of the data set with the way it is stored. In brief, when your data is tidy, each column is a variable, and each row is an observation. Tidy data is important because the consistent structure allows you to focus your struggle on questions about the data, and not fighting the data into the right form for different functions.\n\nOnce you have tidy data, a first step is to transform it. Transformation includes narrowing in on observations of interest eg.(all people in one city, or all data from the last year), creating new variables that are functions of existing variables Together, tidying and transforming are called wrangling, this is because, getting your data in a form that’s natural to work with often, it usually feels like a fight!.\n\n\nOnce you have tidy your data with the variables you need, there are two main engines of knowledge generation: visualization and modeling. These have complementary strengths and weaknesses, so any real analysis will iterate between them many times.\n\n\n\n\nVisualization\nVisualization is a fundamentally human activity. A good visualization will show you things that you did not expect, or raise new questions about the data. A good visualization might also hint that you’re asking the wrong question, or you need to collect different data. Visualizations can surprise you, because they require a human to interpret them.\n\n\n\nModels\nModels are complementary tools to visualization. Once you have made your questions sufficiently precise, you can use a model to answer them. Models are a fundamentally mathematical or computational tool, so they generally scale well. Even when they don’t, every model can make assumptions, and by its very nature a model cannot question its own assumptions. That means a model cannot fundamentally surprise you.\n\n\n\n\nCommunication\nThe last step of data science is communication, an absolutely critical part of any data analysis project. It doesn’t matter how well your models and visualization have led you to understand the data unless you can also communicate your results to others.\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n A[(Import)] --&gt; B[Tidy]\n B --&gt; C(Transform)\n C --&gt; D(Visualize) \n C --&gt; E(Model)\n D --&gt; F{Communicate}\n E --&gt; F\n F --&gt; G[/HTML/]\n F --&gt; H[/PDF/]\n F --&gt; I[/WORD/]\n\n \n \n\n\n\nFigure 1: How R programming work in analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRULES OF THE GAME IN R\n\n\nLike any other game or language, in order to perform or being grammatical correct you have to apply the correct verb for a particular tense. As well as correct action for a specific environment. The same applies to R programming language, for the better result of your data analysis you have to apply the correct package for a specific task, every package contains functions in which there are verbs that act to perform a particular task.\n\nThis will provides an introduction to data science and the R programming language. The goal here is to get your hands dirty right from the start!, We will walk through an entire data analysis, and along the way introduce different types of data analysis question, some fundamental programming concepts in R, and the basics of loading, cleaning, and visualizing data. we will dig into each of these steps in much more detail.\n\n\n\n\nDATA TRANSFORMATION WITH DPLYR.\nIntroduction\nVisualization is an important tool for insight generation, but it is rare that you get the data in exactly the right form you need. Often you’ll need to create some new variables or summaries, or maybe you just want to rename the variables or reorder the observations in order to make the data a little easier to work with. let’s focus on how to use the dplyr package, another core member of the tidyverse.\nThere are five key dplyr functions, which allow you to solve the vast majority of your data-manipulation challenges, These six functions, provide solutions for data manipulation.\nVERBS\n\n(filter()).\n(arrange()).\n(select()).\n(mutate()).\n(summarize()).\n(group_by()).\n\n\n\nFilter\nFilter is one of the verb in tidyverse which usually deals with rows(records) only in your data frame,the main thing it does is to pick observations by their volume depends on the result you intend to achieve. (==,&gt;,&lt;).\n\n\nSelect\nSelect is one of the verb in tidyverse which usually deals with collumn (variables) only in your table data frame,what it does is to select the variables by their names depends on the result you intend to achieve.(=).\n\n\nArrange\nArrange is one of the verb in tidyverse which usually Reorder the rows(Records) of your data frame to allow you get result you intend.\n\n\nSummarize\nSummarize is one of the verb in tidyverse which Collapse many values down to a single summary\n\n\nGroup by\nGroup by is one of the verb in tidyverse used in changes of the scope of each function from operating on the entire data frame to operating on it group-by-group.\n\n\nMutate\nMutate is one of the verb in tidyverse Create new variables with functions of existing variables.\n\nNOTE: All data frame contain Row and Column, therefore rows have to contains Records in it, while column have to contain variables in it (names). to successfully implement the above said verbs, you will have to ensure the following..\n\n\nfirstly you will have to be very clear on What kind of result you need, this depends on the questions.\nSecondly is to understand data provided before importing it to R, for analysis. (To peruse them and see if they are tidy data or messy data).\nThirdly if they are tidy, and you have already understand a question, then you need to know which kind of verb you can use to get the result. but if data are messy, then you will need to tidy them before importation or if already imported then require tidying before further steps.\n“Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.” ––- Leo Tolstoy\n“Tidy data sets are all alike, but every messy data set is messy in its own way.” ––- Hadley Wickham\n\nShortly we have several types of data type….\n\n` Character — these type of data are strings/names.\n` Double/Numeric — these type are measurable data/decimals.\n` Integer — these are numbered data/countable (0 to 9).\n` Factor — these data are categorical/level.\n` Date — Basically deal with dmy.\n\nAbbreviation\n\nint stands for integers.\ndbl stands for doubles, or real numbers.\nchr stands for character vectors, or strings.\ndttm stands for date-times (a date + a time).\n\nR provides the standard suite: &gt;, &gt;=, &lt;, &lt;=, != (not equal), and == (equal). When you’re new in R, the easiest mistake to make is to use = instead of == when testing for equality.\n\n\nR AND TIDYVERSE.\n\nrequire(tidyverse)\n\nLoading required package: tidyverse\n\n\n-- Attaching core tidyverse packages ------------------------ tidyverse 2.0.0 --\nv dplyr     1.1.1     v readr     2.1.4\nv forcats   1.0.0     v stringr   1.5.0\nv ggplot2   3.4.2     v tibble    3.2.1\nv lubridate 1.9.2     v tidyr     1.3.0\nv purrr     1.0.1     \n-- Conflicts ------------------------------------------ tidyverse_conflicts() --\nx dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\nx dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\ni Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\nrequire(lubridate)\nrequire(dplyr)\nrequire(lubridate)\nrequire(readxl)\n\nLoading required package: readxl\n\nrequire(janitor)\n\nLoading required package: janitor\n\nAttaching package: 'janitor'\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    chisq.test, fisher.test\n\nrequire(magrittr)\n\nLoading required package: magrittr\n\nAttaching package: 'magrittr'\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:purrr':\n\n    set_names\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:tidyr':\n\n    extract\n\nrequire(readr)\n\nlets try a to create a vector of 5 kids, include their names, age, food habit, and birth date. by doing this activity, we shall cover all five types of data, which are…\n\n` character\n` numeric\n` integer\n` factor\n` date\n` logical\n\n\n\ncharacter vector (NAMES).\n\nnames = c(\"grace\", \"daniel\", \"collins\", \"ethan\", \"benjunior\")\nnames\n\n[1] \"grace\"     \"daniel\"    \"collins\"   \"ethan\"     \"benjunior\"\n\n\nlets test if our vector is character\n\nis.character(names); is.vector(names); is.factor(names);class(names)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\n\n\nnames[2:5]\n\n[1] \"daniel\"    \"collins\"   \"ethan\"     \"benjunior\"\n\n\n\n\ninteger vector (FOOD)\n\nfood = c(1,2,3,4,5)\nfood\n\n[1] 1 2 3 4 5\n\n\nlets test if our food is integer vector\n\nis.integer(food); is.vector(food); is.character(food); is.numeric(food); is.factor(food)\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n\nnow as we may see our results, show that our integer vector is FALSE, and Numeric is TRUE, then we have to change from numeric to integer.

Data importation in R reefers to the process of calling your data from the directory (file) in your computer into the R studio where you intend to do your analysis.\n\n\nStep 1.\nYou have to know what kind of data you have before importing it in R. Data are usually in different extension, so you have to ensure you put your data in the right extension in your local directory. Eg. xls, csv etc…….\n\n\nStep 2.\nOn your computer open R studio, programming is usually done on console.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Statistics Leson 1.\n\n\nStatistics is a branch of Maths that deals with every aspect of the data/ Also Statistics can be refereed as a knowledge for collecting, analyzing and interpreting data. Statistics can be used to predict the future, determine the probability that a specific event will happen, or help answer questions about a survey. Statistics is used in many different fields such as business, medicine, biology, psychology and social sciences. Statistical knowledge helps to choose the proper method of collecting data and employ those samples in the correct analysis process in order to effectively produce the results. In short, statistics is a crucial process which helps to make the decision based on the data.\n\n\n\n\nWhat is Statistics in Programming?\n\n\nIn Mathematics, statistics concerns the collection of data, organisation, interpretation, analysis and data presentation. An example of statistical analysis is when we have to determine the number of people in a town who watch TV out of the total population in the town. The small group of people is called the sample, which data is taken from them.\n\ndescriptive, which focuses on summarizing data. Inferential, which focuses on making conclusions based on samples and Inferential Statistics Based on the data sample taken from the population, inferential statistics makes the predictions and inferences. Both types of statistics are equally employed in the field of statistical analysis..\n\n\nThe characteristics of Statistics are a:\n\nStatistics are numerically expressed.\nIt has an aggregate of facts\nData are collected in systematic order\nIt should be comparable to each other\nData are collected for a planned purpose\n\n\n\nThe importance of statistics are…\n\nStatistics helps in gathering information about the appropriate quantitative data\nIt depicts the complex data in graphical form, tabular form and in diagrammatic representation to understand it easily\nIt provides the exact description and a better understanding\nIt helps in designing the effective and proper planning of the statistical inquiry in any field\nIt gives valid inferences with the reliability measures about the population parameters from the sample data\nIt helps to understand the variability pattern through the quantitative observations\n\n\nWhy is statistics vital?\nStatistics is an important field because it helps us understand the general trends and patterns in a given data set. Statistics can be used for analyzing data and drawing conclusions from it. It can also be used for making predictions about future events and behaviors. Statistics also help us understand how things are changing over time. The main purpose of using statistics is to plan the collected data in terms of experimental designs and statistical surveys. Statistics is considered a mathematical science that works with numerical data.\n\n\nWhat are the uses of statistics in real life?\nStatistics is an integral part of our lives. It is used in the workplace and everyday life. In the workplace, statistics are often used to analyse what works best for a company’s marketing strategy or how to distribute work among employees. In daily life, statistics can be used to analyse what food you should buy at the grocery store or how much money you spend on purchasing each week. Statistics are everywhere, and they help us make sense of the world around us.\nConcept covered in Statistics.\nThe most important concepts covered in Statistics include - mean, - median - mode - range - standard deviation - Normality and - Significance. Mean and Median in statistics usually measure the median/mean value, but their application depend on the sample’s nature.\n\n\nDescriptive Statistics.\nDescriptive statistics usually used to describe type of data, by describe Median, Mean, Mode and Range in a particular data. The mean is the average of the data set. The median is the middle of the set of numbers, The mode is the most common number in a data set. In these three the mean is the only one that requires formula. Mean in math is what called Average, they are synonym.\n\n\nHow to find Median.\nTo calculate median value when your data values are mostly alike but some few values have big difference from the other either High or Low. The purpose is to avoid the high or low values to affect the result. Basically for numeric data. (1,2,3,4,5,6,7) to find median. you arrange your numbers from the lowest to the highest or from highest to the lowest then you pick the centered number. So in the set 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 the middle number is 4.\nBut what happens if the data set is like (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8)? in that case you arrange your data set and then you add the two middle numbers and then you them divide by 2, (4 + 5 = 9/2 = 4.5). In most cases the median and the mean are likely to have the same value, even when they differ, it’s not in ignificance gap.\n\n\nHow to find mean.\nThere are mainly two ways to find mean in a data set, One is by finding the sum of the values by adding them all up, dividing the sum by the number of values in the data set. Eg. (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) to find mean …… 1 + 2+ 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7= 28/7 = 4 therefor the mean is 4. Remember the mean in a data set does not have to appear in the data set.**\n\n\nThe different between Mean and Median\n\nThe median is less affected by outliers and skewed data, is used for skewed distributions.\nMedian is Usually the preferred measure of central tendency, when distribution is not symmetrical.\nThe mean is usually used for normal distributed data.\n\nStandard deviation\n\nYou have to calculate the deviation in order to measure where your data deviate from the normal value.\n\n\n\nStatistics lesson 2.\nAs we have seen in previous lesson, statistics plays major roll to daily life activities, therefor knowing how to apply statistics in analysis, is not only basic knowledge to acquire but also essential tool to approach and solve some analytic data based questions. So in this lesson we shall focus on the second type of statistics, which often used to transform, analyze and give analytic results, to support decision making. Inferential statistics help to solve many problems which require analytics approach, and scientific based evidence. So if you want to become a data analyst or a good researcher, then this angle is where you should focus attentively.\n\n\nInferential Statistics for numeric data.\nWhile descriptive statistics used to describe type of data, and describe Median, Mean, Mode and Range in a particular data. Then Inferential statistics focus on solutions, or in other word, when Data rise challenges or questions, it’s inferential type of statistic which solve and answer those challenges and questions.\n\n\nData collection theory.\nBegin with sample collection, it is advise to collect at least 10 to 30 percent samples of general population, this is to ensure samples can provide accurate results. This is due to fact that, the less ample you collect the less efficient result you may get, also the more sample you collect might be unnecessary sometimes, this means it might not make any different in results. So it is advice to collect a reasonable samplesize for better utilization of resources and time management.\n\n\nHypothesis Theory.\nHypothesis means the basic assumptions rouse by a researcher or a data annalist, which support or give reasons for Him/Her to conduct a research, or to collect a particular data to clear His/Her doubt. So every researcher always have most common expected result in His/Her assumptions, But whatever results which are assumed to be true or false, are what called Hypothesis.\nThere are two types Hypothesis.\n\nNull Hypothesis – Ho – Negative.\nAlternative Hypothesis – Ha – Positive :::\n\nOften data are collected by researcher(s), who focus on a specific matter or subject, So there are some steps to consider before going field for data collection. Begin by setting your project plan, including project tile and objectives, then finally to rise hypothesis. Now in professional standard, the Hypothesis which used to finalize the research conclusions is Null Hypothesis – Ho – Negative. In statistic analysis, we use different approach to address solutions to our questions, A requires standard approach in statistical analysis, is to test the significance and Insignificance of the data results, and the normality of data distributions. Therefor to be sure about data conclusions, then you have to test data normality, and the significance and Insignificance of the results.\n\n\nTest significance and Insignificance.\n\nNull hypothesis theory = No significant difference.\nAlternative Hypothesis Theory = There is significant difference.\n\nNull hypothesis theory, is usually used to conclude results of the research, and to measure the significance of the results, as well as to measure the normality of data distributions, so many research conclusions are made by using this theory. So the significant level and Normality both are measured by P value.\n\n\nFormula to measure significance of data results.\nIn the case of measuring significance of the results we refer to the formula…\n\nwhen the P value = &gt; 0.05 then it’s considered There is No significant difference. And\nwhen the P value = &lt; 0.05 then it’s considered There is significant difference.\n\n\n\nTest Normality Formula.\n\nNull Hypothesis - Ho = Is normal distributed. while\nAlternative Hypothesis - Ha = Is not normal distributed.\n\nNormality refers to the distribution of your collected data, this means after you have describe your data in descriptive type of statistics, then you have to test them, if they are normal distributed or not normal distributed. In normality formula we prescribe the P level formula other way round, which means,\n\n\nNormality formula.\nIn the case of measuring normality of data distributions we refer to the formula that…\n\nWhen P value = &gt; 0.05 then you Accept the Null.\nWhen P value = &lt; 0.05 then you Reject the Null.\n\n\n\nTest Normality in R.\nIn R, we test the distributions of the data by using the function (shapiro), the below example is how you can test the distribution of the data in R analysis. The data we are using is auto generated from R database. In R you can find some data to help you improve your analysis practice, in case you don’t have access to acquire data from other source. to generate data in R, just create a chunk then write iris then run the chunk, and data will appear on your R editor. After that you can equate them to another name.\n\nrequire(tidyverse)\n\nLoading required package: tidyverse\n\n\n-- Attaching core tidyverse packages ------------------------ tidyverse 2.0.0 --\nv dplyr     1.1.1     v readr     2.1.4\nv forcats   1.0.0     v stringr   1.5.0\nv ggplot2   3.4.2     v tibble    3.2.1\nv lubridate 1.9.2     v tidyr     1.3.0\nv purrr     1.0.1     \n-- Conflicts ------------------------------------------ tidyverse_conflicts() --\nx dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\nx dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\ni Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\n\n\nsample.iris=iris\n\n\n\n\nsample.iris$Sepal.Length %&gt;%  shapiro.test()\n\n\n    Shapiro-Wilk normality test\n\ndata:  .\nW = 0.97609, p-value = 0.01018\n\n\n\nggplot(data = sample.iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length))+\n  geom_density(fill = \"darkred\",alpha = 0.3)+\n  theme_bw()+\n   theme(panel.grid.major.x = element_line(color = \"lightgrey\", linetype = \"dashed\"), panel.grid.major.y = element_line(color = \"lightgrey\", linetype = \"dashed\"), panel.grid = element_line(color = \"white\"), axis.title = element_text(color = \"darkred\", size = 12), axis.text = element_text(color = \"darkred\"), axis.line.x = element_line(linewidth = 1), axis.line.y = element_line(linewidth = 1))\n\n\n\n\nwe have tested Sepal.L data normality in R, and results shows that the are not normal distributed. Then we have tried to plot in order to observe visual distribution, and results still shows that Sepal.Length are not normal distributed.\n\n\nsample.iris$Sepal.Width %&gt;% shapiro.test()\n\n\n    Shapiro-Wilk normality test\n\ndata:  .\nW = 0.98492, p-value = 0.1012\n\n\n\nggplot(data = sample.iris, aes(x = Sepal.Width))+\n  geom_density(fill=\"darkred\",alpha = 0.3)+\n  theme_bw()+\n  theme(panel.grid.major.x = element_line(color = \"lightgrey\", linetype = \"dashed\"), panel.grid.major.y = element_line(color = \"lightgrey\", linetype = \"dashed\"), panel.grid = element_line(color = \"white\"), axis.title = element_text(color = \"darkred\", size = 12), axis.text = element_text(color = \"darkred\"), axis.line.x = element_line(linewidth = 1), axis.line.y = element_line(linewidth = 1))\n\n\n\n\nwe have tested Sepal.Width data normality in R, and results shows that they are normal distributed. Then we have tried to plot in order to observe visual distribution, and results still shows that Sepal.Width are normal distributed.\n\n\nThis is how we test data in R programming language, it is easier and clear as we have seen. S o working your data in R, is not only a recommended tool but also facilitate mass data solutions.\n\n\nCENTRAL LIMIT THEORY (CLT)\nIn statistics the central limit theory means the value on which majority of population falls. It simply states that The distribution approaches normal, as the samples get larger. therefor it is recommended that to attain doubtless results you are required to collect at least &gt;= of 30% samples of the population. This theory of central limit usually shown through continuous plots such as Histogram and density. This is due to their nature. On the figure below we are going to see the example of central limit theory in visualization.\nIn this study we will see how statistics works in real life, and how useful it is in every day’s decision making. By applying a proper and correct method in collecting/recording samples, analyzing, interpreting and sharing of findings is always a best way to reach the right decisions, especially for decision makers, weather in family level.\n\n\nWhat is the purpose of dispersion\nThe purpose is to find out how spread out the data values are, on the number line, the deference between the maximum and the minimum value is the formula to measure dispersion (Measure of spread).\n\n\nWhat does it mean by Measure of central tendency\nSimply is defined as A measure that identifies a single value as representative of the entire distribution. It is the single value that is most typical/representative of the collected data.\nRelated pots"

    "text": "In today’s society, the majority of people have the potential to make significant contributions to their communities. This means that there are only a few individuals who actively contribute while many others benefit from their contributions. While it is beneficial to be part of the group that gains knowledge, being surrounded by ignorant individuals poses a serious problem. In the modern era, learning has become an essential responsibility, thanks to the availability of knowledge at our fingertips through technological advancements.\n\n\n\n\n\nSoft skills.\nReflecting on my past few years, I recall a time when I was completely unaware of online resources and tools like Google. I deliberately mention this because it was incredibly challenging for me to search for solutions to my pressing questions on platforms like Google or other online sources. As a result, I was limited to relying solely on information from books or what I had learned in school. Let me clarify that I’m not suggesting that relying on books is inadequate. However, I aim to emphasize the abundance of relevant and freely available online resources that can shed light on various subjects and expand one’s knowledge.\n\n\nSoft skills, in essence, encompass the additional knowledge one acquires through various means, including open-source online platforms. These skills prove highly relevant in addressing the current challenges faced by communities and enable individuals to stay updated with the rapid changes in modern technology. Therefore, there are no excuses for individuals not to pursue self-improvement, considering the wealth of contributors ready to support and guide them in their areas of interest.\n\nDrawing from my personal experience, today I would like to share a method for safely storing your digital assets online. I mention this because many of us possess numerous ideas and valuable digital content on our computers but are unsure where to store them securely, thus risking loss without proper backup measures. Today’s lesson will provide you with guidance on how to securely store your written work, ideas, and discoveries.\n\n\n\n\nAbout GitHub.\nGitHub is indeed one of the leading and trusted online repositories for storing digital assets. In addition to its storage capabilities, GitHub offers a surprising feature: the ability to create URL addresses for your files with the .HTML extension, making them accessible as web links. This provides an excellent opportunity for you to share your knowledge with others. Now, let me guide you through the steps of creating a GitHub repository and the procedures for pushing your digital assets from your computer to your GitHub repository.\nTo ensure the safety of your software projects and protect them even in the event of a lost or irreparably damaged computer, it is advisable to have a backup solution in place. One highly recommended approach is to utilize a GitHub repository, which allows you to store your software assets online. As an active contributor in the software community, it’s crucial to have a reliable backup method for your valuable work.\nTo get started with creating a GitHub account, you can follow the steps outlined below:\nVisit the GitHub website at https://github.com/. On the GitHub homepage, click on the “Sign up” button located at the top right corner of the page. You will be prompted to enter your desired username, email address, and password for your GitHub account. Fill in the required information accordingly. Choose an appropriate plan based on your needs. GitHub offers both free and paid plans, with different features and benefits. For most individuals, the free plan is sufficient to get started. Once you’ve filled in the necessary details and selected a plan, click on the “Create account” button. GitHub may require you to verify your email address to complete the registration process. Check your email inbox for a verification message from GitHub and follow the instructions provided. After verifying your email address, you’ll be directed to the GitHub website where you can further customize your profile and explore the various features and settings available.\nCongratulations! You’ve successfully created a GitHub account. Now you can start utilizing GitHub repositories to store and manage your software projects, collaborate with others, and benefit from the version control capabilities it offers.\n\n\nProcedures to push properties to GitHub repository.\nBefore you proceed with pushing your properties to GitHub, it is important to ensure that your local repository on your computer is well-organized. Follow these steps to prepare your folders for pushing to GitHub. Ensure that all the necessary folders and files you intend to push to GitHub are organized within the same parent folder on your computer. This parent folder will serve as the root of your local repository.\nAvoid using spaces in the names of your folders and files. While some programming languages can handle spaces in file and folder names, it is generally recommended to use underscores (_) or hyphens (-) instead. This helps to maintain compatibility and ensures smooth operation across different programming tools and platforms. Once you have organized your folders and files, you can proceed with the installation of Git Bash and follow these steps to push your properties to GitHub:\n\n\nCommand lines at first commit.\nOpen the GitBash then write the following command lines.\n\ncd e:\ncd e:/my_properties/teneson\ngit init\ngit add .\ngit commit -m “comment”\ngit remote add origin\ngit push -u origin main\n\n\n\nCommand lines at second+ commit.\nThe first and second lines here under, are examples due to my folders arrangement in my computer, so you should not refer to them exactly as they are, instead you shall write depending on the folder arrangement on your computer. But from line 3 to 5, should be written as they are, only during the first commit to GitHub. Line 4, within a quotation marks, you are advised to write a comment message concerning your properties.\nOpen the GitBash then write the following command lines.\n\ncd e:\ncd e/my_properties/teneson\ngit add .\ngit commit -m “comment on changes you have made”\ngit push\n\nRelated Posts:"

    "section": "",
    "text": "DESCRIPTIONS OF THE CURENT PROCESS.\n\n\nThe following are the steps that a public servant must follow when seeking to transfer from one municipality to another municipality. These procedures are typically handled by local government officials. It is important to note that the public servant initiates the process and after submitting the required documents at the DED’s (District Executive Director) office, they do not have any further involvement until the process is completed. Due to the government’s reliance on a manual process server system, primarily utilizing the Post Office for document delivery, it may take some time for the process to be completed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nprocedures.\n\n\nStep 1.\nThe process starts with the public servant submitting a “Request Letter for a Vacancy” to the District Executive Director (DED) of the Municipal they wish to transfer to. It is important to note that this letter must first go through the officer in charge of the servant’s department and then to the District Executive Director (DED) of the servant’s current Municipal for authorization.\nStep 4.\nAfter receiving the confirmation letter, the District Executive Director (DED) of the servant’s current Municipal will write to the Regional Administration Secretary (RAS) to inform them about the availability of a vacancy. The DED will request the RAS to initiate the process and forward it to the Ministry of State, President’s Office, Regional Administration and Local Government (TAMISEMI). Subsequently, the RAS office will write to the Cabinet Secretary (CS) of TAMISEMI to seek approval for the process.\n\nStep 2.\nThe District Executive Director of the servant’s current work station will authorize the letter and send it to the DED of the Municipal that the servant wishes to transfer to.The same process will be followed at the new Municipal. This means that the letter will be forwarded to the officer in charge of the department to confirm the availability of a vacancy, and then proceed to the DED’s office.\nStep 5.\nThe Cabinet Secretary (CS) for TAMISEMI will review and approve the letter, subsequently forwarding it to the Cabinet Secretary responsible for the Public Service for execution. Once the process is completed at the Public Service Commission (Utumishi), the Permission Letter will be sent by Utumishi (CS) to both the public servant through the DED of their current working station and to the DED of the new Municipal Council.\n\nStep 3.\nUpon receiving and confirming the request, the District Executive Director (DED) of the Municipal that the public servant wishes to transfer to will write a confirmation letter regarding the provision of the vacancy. This letter will be sent back to the public servant through their District Executive Director (DED) to initiate further shifting procedures that will be undertaken by the current DED’s office.\nStep 6.\nThe District Executive Director (DED) of the servant’s current work station will write a permission letter granting approval for the public servant to transfer. This permission letter will be attached to the letter received from the Cabinet Secretary of Utumishi that outlines the requirements to be fulfilled upon reporting to the new Municipal.\n\n\nStep 7.\nThe final step is for the public servant to report to their new working station. This can only be done after receiving the movement permission letter from the District Executive Director (DED) and completing the handover process at their current work station. Upon reporting to the new municipal, the public servant is required to inform the Cabinet Secretary of Utumishi through the DED of the new municipal about their arrival and commencement of duties.\n::: columns :::: {.column width=“50%”}\n\n\nADVANTAGES OF THE CURRENT PROCESS.\n\nDocument Preservation: The current process aligns with the government’s objective of preserving its documents. By following a systematic and regulated procedure, the government ensures the preservation of important information and avoids the risk of exposing classified data.\nValidity and Legality Checks: The current process provides an opportunity for government departments to measure and crosscheck the validity and legality of the transfer. This ensures that officials do not rush or compromise the process and allows for careful observation and assessment.\nSmooth Workflow: The current process allows the government to maintain normal workflow during the execution of the transfer. This helps in avoiding disruptions to work schedules and minimizes additional costs that may arise from the transfer process.\nCurbing Corruption: The structured stages of the current process act as a deterrent to corruption attempts. As the document progresses through various levels of approval, it becomes difficult for any individual to manipulate or expedite the process through unauthorized means.\nCost Savings: One notable advantage of the current process is that it saves government money. Public servants bear the entire cost of their own transfer expenses, reducing the financial burden on the government.\n\n\n\nDISADVANTAGES OF THE CURRENT PROCESS.\n\n\n\nTime and Material Cost: The current process imposes time and material costs on the public servant. Even if there are genuine reasons for the request to transfer, the burden of bearing the costs associated with the relocation falls on the individual. This can create financial strain and inconvenience for the public servant.\n\n\n\nBureaucracy: The current process involves the passage of the permission letter through multiple individuals and departments. This bureaucratic nature of the process increases the risk of delays and potential blockages within the chain of process. It can lead to inefficiencies and prolong the time taken to complete the transfer.\n\n\n\n\nReduced Efficiency: The current process requires the public servant to dedicate a significant amount of time and effort in seeking feedback or following up on their transfer request. This diversion of attention from their regular work responsibilities can result in decreased efficiency and productivity.\nCheating can occur when an unscrupulous public servant intentionally makes mistakes or engages in acts of sabotage within the administration, as there are no legal roles they can fulfill to expedite the process.\n\n\n\nThe flowchart below show an example of shifting produre by request of a public servant for health sector .\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TB\n  A(Public &lt;/br&gt; Servant) -- MOI/DMO/DED -- 1st --&gt; B[DED &lt;/br&gt;New Municipal]\n  B -- 2nd --&gt; C[DED &lt;/br&gt;Current Municipal]\n  C -- 3rd --&gt; D[RAS &lt;/br&gt;Current region]\n  D -- 4th --&gt; E{CS &lt;/br&gt;TAMISEMI For approvall}\n  E -- 5th --&gt; F[(CS &lt;/br&gt;UTUMISHI for execution)]\n  F -- 6th --&gt; C\n  F -- 6th --&gt; B\n  C -- 6th --&gt; A \n  A -- REPORT--&gt;7th--&gt; B \n  B -- DED --8th --&gt; F\n\n\nFigure 1: The current shifting procedural system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPROPOSED PROCEDURES.\nWhile evaluating the current shifting process, it is important to consider several factors as we look to improve the system. To enhance efficiency, we should implement the following measures:\n\n\n\n\nIntegration of an online system.\nBy introducing an online system, we can address various issues associated with the current process. This includes reducing unnecessary delays in reporting, minimizing costs, facilitating feedback between public servants and municipal authorities, and providing easy access for government sectors. Additionally, the online system will help minimize the risk of document loss during the process.\n\n\n\nServant’s Account.\nEach public servant should be required to have a government service account, accessible using their cheq number as a passcode. This account will serve three main purposes:\n\nFiling leave letters.\nClaiming rights and benefits at the workplace, both social and professional.\nSubmitting transfer letters, and similar reports.\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscouragement of personal choice.\nCurrently, public servants can directly seek vacancies in specific municipalities, potentially leading to corruption through collusion with administrators. To address this issue, TAMISEMI (the Ministry of Local Government) should play a role in deciding the municipality to which a servant will be assigned. When a servant requests a vacancy, they should propose three preferred municipalities, leaving the decision to TAMISEMI. This ensures fairness and considers the varying workforce needs of different municipalities.\n\n\n\n\nThe proposed procedures offer several advantages\nTransparency and direct follow-up: The process will provide transparency, allowing servants to track the progress of their requests. If there are any queries or comments from the relevant authorities, servants can respond and fulfill the requirements through the same online platform.\nEnhanced transparency and accountability: Online submission will ensure transparency throughout the government system. Every stage of the process can be tracked, identifying any slowdowns or reasons for delays. This will help alleviate concerns or doubts among public servants regarding senior government officials.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TB\n  A(Servant &lt;/br&gt;Application) -- MOI -- DMO -- DED -- 1st--&gt; B[Ras]\n  B -- 2nd--&gt; C{CS &lt;/br&gt;Tamisemi}\n  C -- 3rd --&gt; D[(CS&lt;/br&gt;UTUMISHI)]\n  D -- 4TH --&gt; A\n  D --&gt; E[New municipal]\n  A -- Report --&gt;E\n\n\nFigure 2: The proposed procedural system."
