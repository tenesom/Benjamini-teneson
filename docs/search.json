    "section": "",
    "text": "A law system is a huge and complex system to understand if not well explained, the system is often well understood by the few individual privileged to serve it.\n\nThe systems deffer from one place to another (One country to another), but the system is basically built under the principles of common laws. This is to say, many system share some similarities and many values.\nIn this session we shall discuss the common law system basically, we shall focus on Tanzania Law and governance system, we shall also look at the Constitution and law making bodies together with their roll. This will help many to simplify the division of power and duties of the government’s arms.\n\nTanzania Governance system.\nIt is usually to be told that in Tanzania the governance system act on the principle of Division of Power, this is to say, the Government is divided in three Arms, 1. Executive 1. Legislature 1. Judiciary\nThese are the arms of the government recognized by the Country’s Constitution of 1977. The constitution further provides general orders. which address the duty and mandate of each arm. Here we shall focus on general provisions.\n\n\nGeneral concept.\nThe concept is usually one and the same, that Avery arm has its main roll, and none of it should interfere the other. It is indeed a theory of how to explain the separation of power, but in reality the reverse is the case, all the government’s arms are somewhere connected direct with each other as well as depend on each other practical.\nThat each arm should not practice or act the duties of other arm, therefor to avoid the conflict of the law, then each arm shall only execute its mandate in accordance with the Constitution. But practically it is total different, because we shall see how each arm operate and where one arm perform the duty of the other accordance with the laws and even the constitution it self.\nRolls of the government’s Arms……\n\nExecutive to execute the laws.\nLegislature to Make the Laws.\nJudiciary to Interpreter the laws.\n\n\n\nLegislature.\nThe law makers, Government’s Adviser and Executive’s Supervisor.\nWe are all familiar with legislature, because this class is formed by the most famous individuals (Politicians), this class constitutionally is formed by political parties and through general election.\nLegislature is formed by two parts……\n\nThe President and\nall members of parliament.\n\n\n\nLeaders of the Legislature\n\nSpeaker of National Assembly, is elected my members but he/she required to be an elected member of parliament.\nDeputy Speaker, who is elected by members but he/she is not obliged to be a member of parliament.\nParliament Secretary, who is appointed by a President and\nParliament’s Chairperson (s).\n\nAlso the Parliament has its traditional and standing orders, which lead it to conduct its daily mandate, the leadership of the parliament is in accordance with the Tanzania constitution of 1977. And in standing orders we find other leaders of the parliament such as parliament chairperson (s), who are elected by members of the parliament and leaders of the committees, who are appointed by Speaker of the national Assembly.\nAmong the members of the parliament is where we also get Government’s\n\nPrime Minister,\nMinisters and\nDeputy Ministers, this is in accordance with the Tanzania Constitution of 1977. The Prime Minister, ministers and deputy ministers are appointed by the President, who is both the part of parliament and the head of government, they serve as top leaders in ministries under an executive arm.\n\nThe president being the part of parliament, means the survival of the parliament is the survival of the president, so in order the Presidency to function it must first open the parliament, as well as the presidency to cease it must cease the parliament. This is what it called SEMI PRESIDENCIAL SYSTEM, (when the parliament cease the President also cease).\n\n\nPolicy to laws.\nThe parliament make laws by discussing and passing the bills by vote of one third of all attended members of parliament, the bills are prepared by the central government and brought to the parliament by a minister or any member of the parliament. After the bills are passed, require the approval of the President to become a Laws.\nTherefor when we say the Parliament makes Laws, simply means The whole members of the parliament and the President, together they make Laws. The laws made by the parliament are called statutes.\n\nStatutes (Written Laws). These are the main laws in the land, after the Constitution which is the Supreme Law.\n\n\n\nThe president as a part of parliament.\nPresident as a part of the parliament doesn’t means he is supposed to attend all the sessions of the parliament, because the prime minister act as the leader of the government’s activities in the parliament. But we normally see the president participate as a part of parliament in two occasion…….\n\nDuring the open and the close of the parliament’s conferences, and\n\nDuring the approval of the bills to laws,\n\nin these two occasion is when the president participate and act as a part of the parliament.\n\n\nExecutive.\nThe Presidency and The law executors.\nMany are familiar with the word “Government”, but this is what it called the Executive, this class is also famous, because it is also made up by political class, it is consist of Country’s …..\n\nPresident,\nVice President and\nPrime Minister.\n\nPresident is the head of executive with the following functions.\n\n\nFunctions of the President.\n\nHead of the State.\nHead of the Government.\nCommander in chief of the armed forces.\n\nThe President act upon those tree mentioned functions, this means, there is a time when the President performs the duties of State, then there is time when the President performs duties of the Government and also the duties of Commander in chief. Through these functions which are provided under the 1977 Constitution of Tanzania, the executive execute its constitutional mandate.\nLaws made by Executives are…….\n\nRegulations,\nbylaws,\nInstruments and\nPolicy\n\nThe cabinet makes Instruments for the Ministries, Ministries make Regulations for its organs, and organs make policy and and Bylaws. This is in accordance with the provision under 1977 constitution where the Parliament delegates some of its power to the Government to act on its behalf in some matters, and on the state of emergency.\nAt the end page I’ve shown through flowchart on how these mentioned laws operate. These laws are minor to those of the parliaments, so if those regulations conflicts with the written law, then it must be taken to the parliament for amendment. And the parliament may amend it or make some suggestions to amend or order the government to reverse it.\n\n\nJudiciary.\nThe Court and The Laws Interpreters.\nJudiciary is one of the Government’s arm, a Judiciary is headed by His Lordship The Chief Justice. Judiciary legality is under the Tanzania Constitution of 1977. and judicial system is consist of…..\n\nChief Justice.\nJustices,\nMagistrates,\nLawyers\nCourt’s Clerks and other administrators\n\nThe head of the judiciary is the Chief justice of Tanzania, who is constitutionally appointed by the President of Tanzania. And once appointed can never be removed, until the retirement.\nIn an exercise of their mandate Judiciary enjoys full liberty and SUO MORTU. Which is the power to intervene any matter with the public interest, also Judiciary is the last decider of all state affairs, simply the judgement of the court is the last decision.\n\n\n\nCourt System.**\n\nPrimary court. (with limited jurisdiction)\nDistrict Court. (with limited jurisdiction)\nResident Magistrate Court. (with limited jurisdiction)\nHigh Courts. (with no jurisdiction)\nCourt of appeal. (with no jurisdiction)\n\nThe Laws interpreted/matters decided by Courts are known as……..\n\nCourt’s Rulings/Judgments\nCourt’s Orders\n\nThen these rulings/Judgement are taken back to the Law school, or education institutes for the purpose of case study, simply they are known as Case Laws (Precedents). These Laws when ruled by a Higher Court, then are usually the binding laws to the subordinates court’s decisions. Also When matter taken to court and it involves one/both of the arms, Courts have power to gives Orders to be executed by both The parliament and Executive.\n\n\nThe current system of Law making and its Execution.\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TB\n  A[(The </br> Republic)] --> B{The </br> Constitution}\n  B --> C[Legislature]\n  B --> D[Executive]\n  B --> E[Judiciary]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TB\n  C[Legislature] --> D[Executive]\n  D -- Bill--> C\n  C --> E{Judiciary's </br> Decisions}\n  D[Executive's </br> Instruments] --> F(Ministry's </br> Regulations and </br> Rules )\n  F --> G(Ministry's Organs, </br> Institutes and </br> Local Governments)\n  G -- Policy --> D\n  G -- Bylaws and guide lines --> A[(The </br> Republic)]\n  E{Judiciary's </br> Decisions} -- Rules and Orders --> A[(The </br> Republic </br>)]\n  E -- Orders --> C[Legislature's </br> Statutes]\n  E -- Orders --> D\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Summary.\nThe concept that Legislature is the only arm that makes Laws, is practically not applicable in common law system, because during the execution, other arms also make some laws to execute both the Mother law as well as other written laws.\nTherefor these are the Executable Laws made under the provision of the constitution of Tanzania of 1977.\n\nThe legislature makes Laws called Statutes/Written Laws.\nThe Executive makes Laws called Instruments, Regulations and Bylaws.\nThe Judiciary makes Laws called Precedents/Case Laws and Rules."

    "text": "Usawa.\nwanadamu wote tunatokana na mfumo mmoja, tunaanza kwa kutungwa mimba, kisha kupita katika mabadiliko kadhaa na baada ya kukamilika muda wa kukaa ndani ya tumbo la mwanamke, ndipo tunazaliwa katika hali ya uchanga. Hatua hii ya awali ya kutungwa mimba hadi kuzaliwa ni hatua tunayoipitia watu wote kwa usawa, kwa sababu hiyo ndiyo maana tunasikia kauli, “Binadamu wote ni sawa.” Usawa wetu unaanzia katika mchakato wa kutungwa mimba na kuishia kuzaliwa, baada ya hapo kila mmoja wetu anaanza kutengeneza “Upekee” au “Uniqueness.”\n\nUpekee huo mara nyingi unachagizwa na mambo kadhaa\n\nTabia ya wazazi\nTabia ya jamii inayomzunguka\nHali ya mazingira anayoingiliana nayo\nTaaluma\nImani nk.\n\nMambo hayo ni baadhi ya yale yanayochangia kwa kiasi kikubwa jamii kuwa na watu wenye tabia tofauti tofauti kwa upekee wao. Kwa sababu hiyo inatufanya tuwe tunategemeana kutokana na tofauti zetu.\n\n\nUumbaji wa Mungu.\nKufuatia utofauti wa tabia zetu zinazotengenezwa na baadhi ya mambo niliyoyaorodhesha hapo juu, binadamu tunagawanyika katika nadharia ya Uuumbaji. Naiita nadharia kwa sababu haiwezi kutafsiriwa kwa matendo ya kibinadamu. Katika mgawanyiko huo miongoni mwa watu, kunasababisha kuzaliwa “Imani” mbalimbali Ulimwenguni.\nImani hizi zinatokana na Urithi wa mapokeo kutoka kwa wahenga, uzoefu wa maisha mtu anaoupata kupitia changamoto mbalimbali, maingiliano ya jamii mbalimbali, Taaluma zenye msingi wa Sayansi. Haya yote kwa pamoja yanachangia kuleta mgawanyiko wa kimtizamo miongoni mwa watu, haswa linapokuja suala la Uumbaji wa mwanadamu na Dunia.\nZifuatazo ni baadhi ya Imani na tofauti zake za kimtizamo juu ya Uweza wa kimungu.\n\nATHEISM — NO GOD\nAGNOSTICISM — DO NOT KNOW\nANIMISM — SPIRITS ARE gods\nPOLYTHEISM — Many gods\nDUALISM — two gods (good and bad)\nMONOTHEISM — ONE GOD\nDEISM — CREATOR CAN NOT CONTROL\nTHEISM — CREATOR CAN CONTROL\nEXISTENTIALISM — EXPERIENCE IS GOD\nHUMANISM — MAN IS GOD\nRATIONALISM — REASON IS GOD\nMATERIALISM — ONLY MATTER IS REAL\nMYSTICISM — ONLY SPIRITY IS REAL\nMONISM — MATTER & SPIRITY IS ONE\nPANTHEISM — ALL IS GOD\nPANENTHESM — GOD IS IN ALL\n\n\n\nUmoja, Muungano, Mshikamano, Ushirikiano.\nJamii za ulimwengu zimepitia vipindi tofauti tofauti hadi kufikia nyakati hizi za sasa, Nyakati nyingi zilikuwa ngumu na zenye maumivu makubwa kwa baadhi ya jamii, Kufuatia uzoefu tunaojifunza kutokana na matukio, tunajikuta inabidi tutengeneze Mtindo wa maisha (Life Style). Aidha ni kumbukumbu mbaya au nzuri, zote zinatutengeneza kuwa vile tulivyo. Kwa uzeufu huo jamii zinaingiliana na kujikuta katika mifumo mbalimbali ikiwemo,\n\nMuungano (Union)\numoja (Unity)\nMshikamano (Solidarity)\nUshirikiano (Colaboration)\nShirikisho (Federation)\n\nHizi zote ni jitihada za kuwafanya wanadamu kuishi pamoja kwa Amani na Upendo huku wakuvumiliana kwa tofauti za tabia zao. (Tolerance) and remain (United out of our differences). katika jitihada hizo za kuifanya dunia sehemu salama kwa kila kiumbe na mazingira, zinaundwa sheria, sera, miongozo na Elimu za aina tofauti tofauti ili kuileta jamii pamoja.\nHayo niliyoyaeleza hapo juu japo kwa uchahe, ni Mfumo wa jamii kwa ujumla wake, lakini kwa kutambua kwamba jamii inaundwa na mtu mmoja mmoja, basi ndio lengo mahususi la kuandaa makala hii niliyoipa jina la “MAKUNDI YA TABIA.”\nMakundi haya nimeyaweka katika mjumuisho, lakini tabia hizi zinawahusu mtu mmoja mmoja, ili kuweza kustahimili makwazo, furaha na maumivu unayoweza kuyapata kutokana na tabia za watu wengine kwenye jamii yako, Basi hakuna budi kuanza kwa kutambua tabia za watu, kisha kujua mbinu unazoweza kuzitumia kusudi kuweza kuchukuliana nazo.\nIli uweze kuwa salama katika jamii iliyochanganyika kwa tofauti ya Mila, Desturi na Tamaduni, ni vyema ukapata muda wa kujua njia nyepesi ya kuishi na jamii hiyo kwa kutumia akili kubwa zaidi ya wengine. Hakuna budi kujifunza hayo kwa sababu, hatuwezi kujitenga na jamii tuliyonayo, isipokuwa tunachangia elimu na fikra chanya kusudi kuifanya jamii ibadilike na kuwa njema.\n\n\nMakundi ya Tabia za watu.\n\nMELANKOLIKI\nKARELIKI\nSANGWINI\nFLAGMETIKI\n\n\nTabia hizo zote zinatofautisha watu katika jamii, na baadhi ya tabia hizo zinageuka kuwa sifa ya upekee kwa baadhi ya watu katika jamii zetu. aidha ni sifa hitajika au ni sifa mbaya.lakini kwa ujumla tabia zote zina pande zote mbili (Uzuri/Uimara na Ubaya/udhaifu wake).\n\nJe, tunajuaje tabia ya mtu kwa sifa zilizoorodheshwa.?\nMfano:\nkatika matukio, Safarini au Sherehe au Msiba. Ili kuweza kumtambua mtu kwa aina ya tabia yake, ni vigumu kidogo, kwa sababu hupaswi kuwa mwepesi wa kutoa hitimisho juu ya tendo au matendo na maneno ya Mtu kwa kutegemea tukio moja. hivyo yakubidi upate muda wa kutosha kukaa na mtu ndipo utagundua kwa undani tabia yake ni ya aina gani.\nKatika jamii tunayoishi tumezungukwa na watu pamoja na vitu mbalimbali. kila kimoja kikiwa na umuhimu wa kipekee kwa kingine. yaani maingiliano au mategemeano ya watu,nvitu na viumbe hai vingine. Japo kuna masomo mengi yanayohusu maingiliano au mategemeano kati ya viumbe hai na mazingira, ila leo nataka tujifunze kidogo kuhusu tabia kuu nne(4) za wanadamu. namna gani ya kuzigundua/kuzitambua na jinsi gani ya kuchukulina/kuishi nao, hao watu wenye tabia hizo.\nWatu wengi tumekuwa wepesi kutengeneza marafiki bila kujali tunataka marafiki wa aina gani, tumejikuta tukiingia katika uhasama, uadui mkubwa na walewale tuliotengeneza nao urafiki. hii inatokana na uelewa mdogo wa tabia na mtindo wa maisha yetu sisi wenyewe na maisha ya wengine pia. kwa sababu huwezi ukajua tabia za watu kama wewe mwenyewe hujijui ni mtu wa tabia ya aina gani.\nhivyo kupitia somo hili tutajifunza kitu cha muhimu sana kuhusu aina za tabia ili kwanza tujitambue sisi wenyewe tuna tabia zipi, ili tuweze kujua na tabia za wengine, kisha kutambua huko kutuwezeshe kutupa/kutujengea namna bora ya kuchagua marafiki au jinsi ya kuishi/kuchukuliana na marafiki tulionao.\nNikufahamishe pia kuwa katika wanadamu takribani wote, wana tabia kuu nne(4), hata wale wenye maradhi ya akili na watoto wadogo ambao bado hawajafikia viwango vya kuzifikirisha akili zao katika mambo ya kijamii kwa ujumla, wote wanaingia katika makundi haya.\n\n\nMelankoliki:\n\nWatu hawa mimi binafsi napenda kuwaita (Makamanda). kwa hakika ni watu imara. kuanzia mitizamo mpaka matendo. Hodari katika kazi na wachangiaji mahiri wa mabadiliko ya kijamii. Hawapendi mizaha, na ni watu wenye hasira sana pale unapokwenda kinyume na maatakwa yao, wanajiamini sana na ni watendaji wazuri, wanapenda kuwa maarufu kwa mambo wanayoyafanya. kiufupi watu hawa wakitaka lao basi lazima litimie, iwe kwa nguvu au hiyari, ni watu wa maamuzi, wana tamaa ya mafanikio ya haraka. ni waaminifu sana kwa vitu vyao na vya wengine haswa mali za jumuiya, wanaweza kufanya lolote ilimradi tu watimize malengo yao, watu hawa ukiwapa kazi basi ni majembe haswa.\nUdhaifu wa Melankoliki:\nShida ya watu hawa kubwa ya kwanza ni kwamba hawakubali kosa kirahisi, hata kama ni la dhahiri, mara nyingi hujiona ni wakamilifu wa tabia na matendo. pia hawapendi sana kusikiliza wengine, wanaamini wao pekee ndo wapo sahihi, huwa wanabeba vinyongo/visasi endapo ukiwakosea, si wepesi kusamehe, mara nyingi wanapenda kulazimisha watu wafuate mambo/mawazo yao, hawapendi kushindwa, ni wepesi kukurupukia mambo bila kujali madhara yake, hivyo hujikuta wakipata hasara kubwa. kiufupi hawaambiliki, huwa hawana marafiki wengi, na wakipata rafiki ni rahisi kupishana na kuachana kabisa, wanapenda ushindani, kwa mapungufu yao hayo hujikuta wakitengwa au kuchukiwa na watu wenye tabia zingine, wanatabia ya uchoyo, ni wagumu sana kukabiliana na ukweli unaohusu mapungufu yao.\nJinsi ya kuchukuliana na Melankoliki:\nUkitaka kuishi na watu hawa kwa amani na upendo basi wewe penda kuwasikiliza zaidi wao na kukubaliana nao hata kama hutatenda wanavyotaka ila wape nafasi pindi wanapotaka kusema au kutenda mambo yao, usiwakosoe hadharani mtajenga uadui, wanapenda kujua mipango ya watu na malengo ya watu wengine kwa sababu wanapenda ushindani, hivyo ukiwa unampa mipango ya wengine anafurahi sana, lakini pia usiwakosoe mara kwa kwa mara huwa hawawezi kukabiliana na ukweli kwa sababu ya mapungufu yao, waheshimu usifanye ushindani nao huwa wana visasi na hasira za haraka, ni watu wa kupenda sifa hivyo ukiwasifia huwa wanapenda sana, mara nyingi waunge mkono katika mambo yao, basi mtaishi kwa amani sana.\n\nSangwini:\n\nWatu hawa huitwa (komedi). Wanapenda masihara sana, yaani kama sangwini akikutana na melankoliki basi hapo hakuna maisha, watu hawa wanapenda michezo, utani mwingi hata katika kazi, ni watu wa mizaha, hata katika mambo ya msingi anaweza akafanya mzaha, mfano mnaweza mkawa katika kikao cha kujadili maendeleo au kusuluhisha watu basi yeye akaleta mizaha tu, ni wacheshi, wanapenda utani sana wana ushawishi, wanapenda kujulikana(umaarufu). hawana hasira za haraka, wana marafiki wengi, mara nyingi jamii inawapenda kwa ucheshi na ushirikiano wao na watu, ni wepesi kupata marafiki.\nUdhaifu wa sangwini:\nwatu hawa mara nyingi hawawezi kufanya kazi zinazohitaji umakini, kwa mfano ngazi za maamuzi na uongozi katika mambo yanayohusu maisha ya wau. hawaaminiki sana na jamii katika mambo ya msingi kwa sababu ya tabia yao ya masihara, huwa hawajui mipaka ya utani hivyo wakati mwingine wanajikuta amewakwaza watu, huwa wanatabia ya uongo, ni wazungumzaji kupita kiasi, hawaishiwi maneno ila mengi ni ya mizaha na utani, wachonganishi na umbea.\nJinsi ya kuchukuliana na Sangwini:\nPenda kumpa sapoti/kumuunga mkono katika mwendelezo wa utani, usimpe nafasi kusimamia mambo yako ya msingi, usijaribu kushindana naye, maana si wepesi wa hasira hivyo utajikuta unakwazika mwenyewe, hivyo pale wanapoleta utani au masihara basi wewe mpuuzie. muoneshe mpo pamoja, washirikishe katika kusherehesha au kukaribisha watu katika sherehe, michezo au hafla za kijamii hapo mtapatana sana.\n\nKareliki:\n\nWatu hawa mara nyingi huitwa (watu makini, smart people). huwa ni watulivu, hawana papara na mambo, hupenda kuyajua mambo kiundani sana kabla hajalifanya au kuzungumza, hawaamini kila jambo, ni watafiti, hata mawazo yao pia hupenda kuyapima kama yaapo sahihi au lah. huwapa watu nafasi ya kuwasikiliza, ni waamuzi wazuri, washauri wazuri, wapangiliaji wa mambo kwa mikakati, mara nyingi hupenda kujifunza, ni waongeaji wazuri sana, ni rahisi kutengeneza marafiki wapya, wanaushawishi katika jamii kwenye mambo yote ya mipango na maamuzi, wana uwezo wa kimasomo, ni watu wa kiasi, hawana makuu, hawapendi sifa, ni watetezi wazuri wa watu, ni waaminifu, huwa wanapata bahati ya kupendwa sana na watu.\nUdhaifu wa Kareliki:\nKama tulivyoona watu hawa walivyo na sifa nyingi kama malaika, na ukweli ni kwamba wako hivyo, ila wana udhaifu ambao pia ni hatari na mbaya sana, kwanza ni wavivu wa baadhi ya kazi, hawapendi kazi zenye changamoto nyingi, yaani misukosuko, mara nyingi wanajiepusha na changamoto, jambo hilo linawafanya mara nyingi wasifanikiwe sana kimaisha, tofauti na melankoliki ambaye yeye ni mzee wa sukuma twende litakalotokea na litokee, pia watu hawa sio wepesi kufanya maamuzi, hivyo jambo linaweza likaharibikia mikononi mwao bila maamuzi ya haraka, lakini pia hawana nguvu sana za mwili, jambo linalowasababishia wakati mwingine kushindwa kukabiliana na changamoto ngumu za maisha, pale wanapokosa nafasi wanazoweza kutenda vizuri, ni wepesi kupoteza marafiki japo wanawapata kirahisi, huwa hawana tabia ya kujali sana watu wanapokuwa nao mbali, yaani kama mawasiliano au kutembeleana.\nJinsi ya kuchukuliana na Kareliki:\nWatu hawa hawana changamoto sana kuishi nao kwa sababu ya asili ya tabia zao, hivyo wewe penda kuwashauri na kuwasihi wajaribu kufanya vile vitu unavyoona wanaweza kuvifanya kwa usahihi, utakuwa umemsaidia sana, pia penda kuwahimiza maana ni wazito wa mambo mengi haswa maamuzi yanayohitaji uharaka, ila penda sana kuwashauri maana ni wepesi kupokea mawazo yaani ni waelewa, watie moyo pale wanapofeli na kuwasaidia katika zile kazi unazohisi hawezi kuvumilia kuzifanya. Basi hapo utakuwa umempata.\n\n\nFlagimetiki:\n\nWatu hawa wanaitwa (wandani). Hawa ni watu wasiri mnooo, yaani unaweza ukaishi naye aidha ni mwanao au mkeo au rafiki au jirani, lakini kitu utaishia kujua ni salamu, anaweza akaumwa asikwambie, akafanikiwa jambo asiseme, akapatwa na tatizo au kheri asikwambie, wanaitwa wandani/wasiri, ni watu wapole, sio wazungumzaji sana hata kwa watu waliowazoea, wakimya, hawana marafiki wengi, hawapendi mijumuiko, huwa wanajiamini peke yao, ni wachapakazi sana, wanakaa wapweke muda mwingi, huwa wanauwezo mzuri kimasomo, huwa wanapenda ukweli, ni watendaji waaminifu katika kazi, hawapendi kabisa mashindano na watu wengine, ni watunzaji wazuri wa siri za watu au ofisi.\nUdhaifu wa Flagimetiki:\nWatu hawa udhaifu wao mkubwa ni siri wanazozibeba, huwa zinawatesa na wakati mwingine kuwaletea madhara makubwa katika maisha, pili upweke wa kuwa peke yao huwapa msongo wa mawazo, ni rahisi kukosea maana hawana mashirikiano mazuri na jamii(umoja), huwa hawaamini watu wengine. wanatabia ya uongo mara nyingi, wanabeba hasira nyingi na visasi, ni wakali sana, anaweza akawa na suluhisho la jambo na asilitoe kwa watu, wana tabia ya uchoyo, wakitaka lao mpaka lifanikiwe ila kwa siri, ni waoga sana.\nJinsi ya kuchukuliana na Flagimetiki:\nWatu hawa hawapendi kusemeshwa mara kwa mara, hivyo ukiishi naye wewe penda kumpa maelekezo kamili kisha muache aendelee na majukumu yake, ukitaka kujua mambo yake kaa naye kwa muda kidogo usikurupuke kumuuliza subiri mpaka yeye akuambie, usipende kumkwaza maana wanabeba visasi, wanapenda kubembelezwa, usipende kuwaambia habari za wengine hawapendi sana, ukimpa kazi za siri kama za ofisi au serikali basi umempa mtu sahihi, onesha kumjali yeye sio kuliko mtu mwingine ili akuamini, kwa sababu ni wabinafsi.\nKuzitambua tabia za watu kwa haraka, katika matukio mafupi.\nkawaida yapo mazungumzo yanayoweza kukupa picha ya mtu uliyekutana naye katika hafla au tukio la muda mfupi kupitia mazungumzo ya wakati huo. Kwenye usafiri au sokoni au mikutano ya hadhara, ni sehemu rahisi zaidi kupata watu wenye tabia zote kwa mara moja. Lakini hembu tuangalie wepesi wa kutambua tabia ya mtu kwenye usafiri wa uma (Daladala).\n\n\nKisa cha Kondakta na Abiria.\nAbiria mmoja kapungukuwa nauli, kisha anampa kondakta nauli pungufu,\nkondakta anamwambia “aisee nimalizie nauli yangu mzee baba.”\nabiria anajibu “mzee sina nisaidie, nimepungukiwa”\nmara ghafla mzozo unaanza ndani ya gari. basi ukiwa makini hapa utagundua tabia za watu kirahisi sana.Kwani sababu\nMelankoliki lazima atasema tu “Watu wengine bhana kwani mlikotoka hamkujua mtapanda magari? kazi usumbufu tu, lipa nauli ya watu bhana au ushuke, hatutaki usumbufu sisi.”\nSangwini naye hawezi kupitwa lazima utamsikia tu atasema “Wewe mtoto wa kiume unapanda gari huna nauli unategemea nini, una nini cha kumpa konda, au unataka ulipiwe.”? Basi hapo kuna mawili aidha watu wacheke au ugomvi uhamie kwa sangwini na abiria aliyepungukiwa naui.\nKareliki naye lazima achangie mada, maana hawa wote ni waongeaji ila wenye tabia tofauti hivyo utamsikia atasema. “Konda kwani hiyo nauli yake imepelea kiasi gani.?” kisha kama anayo utaona anaingia mfukoni analipa.\nFlagimetiki, hutamsikia akichangia mada au hata kucheka, yeye kimyaa kama hayupo vile,\n\n\nHitimisho.\nnadhani kupitia mfano wa kisa hicho cha Kondakta na Abiria, wengi mumeshakutana nayo, na ni dhahiri umepata picha kwa ukubwa zaidi kwa kile nilichokifundisha.\nTunapaswa kuwajuwa watu kwa makundi ya tabia zao, na sio kuwageuza watu kuwa ndio tabia zao, mwanadamu ni kiumbe pekee anayeweza kubadilika kwa kadiri ya muda unavyoamua na vile utashi wake unavyomuongoza, hivyo watu wanasoma, wanaumizwa, wanajifunza na wanakua kimo na fikra, kisha kupitia hayo wanabadilika.\nKumfanyia mtu mjumuisho kwamba ni mtu wa tabia fulani na hawezi kubadilika, ni kukosoa au kutilia shaka uwezo wa Mungu aliouweka ndani ya Mtu, na kutokuamini katika mabadiliko ya kimaumbile, Tujifunze zaidi kuliko kusoma, kusudi tuwe mabadiliko tunayoyatamani katika jamii zetu.\nRelated Posts:"

    "text": "WORLD POPULATION DATA: This post is the result of R programming analysis, which basically demonstrate the most current world population of each continent and most popular countries within a continental level. R is a powerful language when it comes to analysis and documentation, this post is the one of R’s multiple way of communication. i have also generated pdf and word documents through from R Studio editor.\n\n\nWORLD POPULATION DATA.\nQuestions.\n\nFind the world’s most popular continent.\nThe most popular country in every continent.\nThe trend of the world population based on data given.\n\nThe data given is from reliable source, consist of the world’s population data from 1970 to 2022.\n\n\nData Summary.\nThe data below requires, to find the most popular continent on Earth, the most popular country on Earth and the general population growth trend. So we are going to import our data in R studio then the next step is to look weather the data are tidy or not, if Yes then we straight move to answer the question and if Not then we need to tidy them so that we are able to use them.\n\nChoosen packages.\n\nTidyverse::\nreadr::\nLubridate::\nreadxl::\nmagrittr::\njanitor::\ndplyr::\n\nAbout the chosen package.\nThese packages are chosen specifically to handle all activities in this task. Each package functions accordingly. This packages provide several functions that are key tools to facilitate the coding. One can choose the way makes him or her relevant in doing activities in coding. Especially when it comes to package arrangements, firstly understanding of the result required, is usually every coder’s concerns. But how one apply the calling of packages differ from one another.\nMy self i prefer to call all the package in the very first Chunk, this is because i already know all the necessary function() I’ll be required to use when coding. So the mentioned package in this assignment are already set in a first chunk.\n\nrequire(tidyverse)\n\nLoading required package: tidyverse\n\n\n-- Attaching core tidyverse packages ------------------------ tidyverse 2.0.0 --\nv dplyr     1.1.0     v readr     2.1.4\nv forcats   1.0.0     v stringr   1.5.0\nv ggplot2   3.4.1     v tibble    3.1.8\nv lubridate 1.9.2     v tidyr     1.3.0\nv purrr     1.0.1     \n-- Conflicts ------------------------------------------ tidyverse_conflicts() --\nx dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\nx dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\ni Use the conflicted package (<http://conflicted.r-lib.org/>) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\nrequire(lubridate)\nrequire(dplyr)\nrequire(lubridate)\nrequire(readxl)\n\nLoading required package: readxl\n\nrequire(janitor)\n\nLoading required package: janitor\n\nAttaching package: 'janitor'\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    chisq.test, fisher.test\n\nrequire(magrittr)\n\nLoading required package: magrittr\n\nAttaching package: 'magrittr'\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:purrr':\n\n    set_names\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:tidyr':\n\n    extract\n\nrequire(readr)\nrequire(readxl)\n\n\n\nData Entry.\n\nworld = read_csv(\"e:/Mystafs/blogswebsite/teneson/posts/Current-world-pop/The world population data/world_population.csv\") \n\nRows: 234 Columns: 17\n-- Column specification --------------------------------------------------------\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr  (4): CCA3, Country, Capital, Continent\ndbl (13): Rank, 2022 Population, 2020 Population, 2015 Population, 2010 Popu...\n\ni Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\ni Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\nThe table above has some input that can not be proper managed with R language, so we must clean them and left with what we are going to use to answer the question asked.\n\npop = world %>% \n  clean_names() %>% \n  select(-c(1:2, 4, 7:17)) %>% \n  rename(\"population\" = 3)\n\n\ncon = pop %>% filter(continent == \"Asia\")\n\ncon1 = pop %>% filter(continent == \"Africa\")\n\ncon2 = pop %>% filter(continent == \"North America\")\n\ncon3 = pop %>% filter(continent == \"South America\")\n\ncon4 = pop %>% filter(continent == \"Europe\")\n\ncon5 = pop %>% filter(continent == \"Oceania\")\n\n\n\n\nCONTINENTS POPULATION.\n\ncont = bind_rows(con, con1, con2, con3, con4, con5)\n\n\nggplot(data = cont, aes(x = continent, y = population))+ \n  geom_col(fill = \"blue\")+ \n  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = 0.4), \n        axis.line = element_line(colour = 1, size = 0.4), \n        axis.text = element_text(colour = 1, size = 11), \n        axis.title = element_text(colour = 17, size = 16))\n\nWarning: The `size` argument of `element_line()` is deprecated as of ggplot2 3.4.0.\ni Please use the `linewidth` argument instead.\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally a graph above demonstrate the world population by continent, the most to miner populated continent on Earth. Asia is leading the chart followed by Africa.\n\n\nASIA\nThe graphs below show Asian continent population from high to low level, graph number one is not well arranged, sample were entered to the database the way they were collected, in fact without consideration of proper arrangement from the highest to the lowest number, it shows the original data, so we had to arranged it in an order that can be proper viewed In graph number two in ascending order.

    "section": "",
    "text": "This post is showing the meaning of Jurisdiction, attached with Court’s judgement as reference, it’s useful in legal matters in Tanzania.\n\n\nJURISDICTION\nIt is fundamental issue that the Court may raise suo motu whenever appropriate. Hulsbury’s Laws of England, 4th Edition, Reissue Vol. 10, para. 314, defines jurisdiction as follows:\n“By ’jurisdiction: is meant the authority which a court has to decide matters that are litigated before it or to take cognizance of matters presented in a formal way for its decision. The limits of this authority are imposed by the statute, charter or commission under which the court is constituted, and may be extended or restricted by similar means”.\nThe case of Bestcom Company Ltd vs. Jacob Mtalitinya t/a IT Farm, High Court of Tanzania at Dar es Salaam Civil Case No. 160 of 2012 (unreported) has explained the issues of pecuniary jurisdiction in deep.\nPecuniary jurisdiction of the High Court of Tanzania It starts where pecuniary jurisdiction of the District Courts and Resident Magistrate’s Courts in respect of movable properties and immovable properties are limited and above indefinitely.\nPecuniary jurisdiction of the District Courts and Resident Magistrate’s Courts Section 22 of the Written Laws (Miscellaneous Amendments) Act, No. 3 of 2016 establishes the pecuniary jurisdiction of the Primary Courts in respect of movable properties is limited to Tshs. 200 Million while for immovable properties is limited to Tshs. 300 Million.\nPecuniary jurisdiction of the Primary Courts Section 20 of the Written Laws (Miscellaneous Amendments) Act, No. 3 of 2016 establishes the pecuniary jurisdiction of the Primary Courts in respect of movable properties is limited to Tshs. 30 Million while for immovable properties is limited to Tshs. 50 Million.\nThe Court of Appeal in Tanzania Friendship Textile Mill vs. Our Lady of the Usambara Sisters [2006] TLR 70 held that the High Court did not have jurisdiction to determine civil suits in which the quantum of damages sought fell within the pecuniary jurisdiction of District Courts and Courts of Resident Magistrates.\n\n\nSubject matter jurisdiction\nAll land cases now fall under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Land and Housing Tribunals and the Land Division of the High Court, established under the Land Disputes Courts Act [CAP. 216 R.E. 2002].\n“commercial case” is defined under Section 2 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act [CAP. 11 R.E. 2002] means a civil case involving a matter considered to be of commercial significance including but not limited to-\n(i) the formation of business or commercial organization;\n(ii) the governance of a business or commercial organization;\n(iii) the contractual relationship of a business or commercial organization with other bodies or persons outside it;\n(iv) the liability of a commercial or business organization or its officials arising out of its commercial or business activities;\n(v) the liabilities of a commercial or business person arising out of that person’s commercial or business activities;\n(vi) the restructuring or payment of commercial debts by or to business or commercial organization or person;\n(vii) the winding up or bankruptcy of a commercial or business organization or person;\n(viii) the enforcement of commercial arbitration award;\n(ix) the enforcement of awards of a regional court or tribunal of competent jurisdiction made in accordance with a Treaty or Mutual Assistance arrangement to which the United Republic is a signatory and which forms part of the law of the United Republic;\n(x) admiralty proceedings; and\n(xi) arbitration proceedings.\n\nWriting on such rules in common law jurisdictions, Elmer Driedger, in his Construction of Statutes (Toronto: Butterworths, 1983, p. 1), observes:\n“The notion has long prevailed that three different rules or approaches may be employed in ascertaining the meaning of a statute. First, there is said to be the ‘purpose’ approach or ‘mischief rule’…. Then there is said to be the ‘literal’ approach or ‘plain meaning’ rule. Finally there is what is called the ‘golden rule’.”\nIn Renada Minerals Corporation vs. Consolidated Holding Corporation & Anor, High Court of Tanzania at Arusha, Civil Case No. 52 of 1999 (unreported). In that case, Rutakangwa, J. (as he then was), held that section 13 of the CPC is a rule of procedure and not of jurisdiction and, as such, cannot be construed to take away the jurisdiction of this court to entertain matters simply because it requires suits to be instituted in the lowest court competent to try it. His Lordship stated as follows (after citing with approval Mulla on The Code of Civil Procedure, 16th edition):\n\nIt is my holding therefore, that s. 13 of the CPC 1966 does not oust the jurisdiction of this court in respect of suits of this nature which by their monetary value ought to be commenced in the district or even in the primary courts. If by sheer inadvertence or for the sake of convenience a plaintiff institutes a suit of this nature which by virtue of s. 13 of the CPC 1966 as a matter of procedure and policy ought to have been instituted in one of the two subordinate courts, this court, has the option of either returning the\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nplaint to the plaintiff under Order VII rule 10 of the CPC 1966 or trying and determining the same.” [emphasis mine]\n\n\nThe decision of the Court of Appeal in Tanzania China Friendship Textile Mill vs. Our Lady of the Usambara Sisters [2006] held that, the High Court did not have jurisdiction to determine civil suits in which the quantum for damages sought fell within the pecuniary jurisdiction of District Courts and Courts of Resident Magistrates. The effect of that decision is to exclude the option of applying Order VII rule 10 of the CPC, which would have allowed this court to either try the case itself, or return the plaint to the plaintiff for filing in a registry of a competent subordinate court. The only remaining option, following Usambara Sisters, is to strike out the suit.\nRelated Posts:"

In R we use different approach when it comes to data manipulation, different from other languages, so once given data, the first thing to understand is its type.\n\nThe data below are not in tidy form, therefor we have to tidy them firstly.

But yet the data frame shows that ages of kids are not specified, some are actual and some are unspecific, therefore we are going to predict some values that can help in analysis, where age is below 6 we shall put 5, and where is above 13 we shall put 14, then we will specify in detail in an output. Here we shall use pivot function of janitor package which is in tidyverse package.\n\nmbili = moja %>% pivot_longer(names_to = \"kids\", values_to = \"number\", cols = 7:26) %>% \n  mutate(gender = c(\"boys\", \"girls\") %>% rep(times = 185460),\n         age = seq(5, 14, 1) %>% rep(each = 2) %>% rep(times = 18546)) \n\nNow we deselect kids column and registration number column.\n\ntatu = mbili %>% select(-c(5,7))\n\n\n\nR Studio auto generated data.\nWe can also get data from R studio itself, Now lets jump strait to Rstudio on computer and see how you can get data, and see how to tidy data and share the results.\nTemperature Data.\n\nsample1 = rnorm(n = 10, mean = 26, sd = 2) %>% as_tibble() %>% mutate(sample = \"samp1\")\n\nsample2 = rnorm(n = 20, mean = 26, sd = 2) %>% as_tibble() %>% mutate(sample = \"samp2\")\n\nsample3 = rnorm(n = 30, mean = 26, sd = 2) %>% as_tibble() %>% mutate(sample = \"samp3\")\n\nsample4 = rnorm(n = 40, mean = 26, sd = 2) %>% as_tibble() %>% mutate(sample = \"samp4\")\n\nsample5 = rnorm(n = 50, mean = 26, sd = 2) %>% as_tibble() %>% mutate(sample = \"samp5\")\n\n\nBind rows and columns.\nHow to bind different samples to a one data set, you either combine rows or columns. We use the function bind_rows/bind_col.\n\ndata.sample = bind_rows(sample1,\n                        sample2,\n                        sample3,\n                        sample4,\n                        sample5)\n\nWe have created different sample size and bind five samples together, we have used the function binding_rows to bind. We have named them (data.sample). But these data are auto-generated from the system, so they change from time to time as you run your chunk. Therefor in order to permanently use them without changes, then you’ll need to save them in your directory.\n\n\n\nHOW TO SAVE AUTO GENERATED DATA TO YOUR COMPUTER.\nWhen you import data into R, we use the function read_. But to save generated data from the system to local directory we apply the function write_, and you may save it in whatever extension you often use. Here under is the function plus application to save the data generated from the system in local directory. Our new data will be called datasample. We put a comment (#) so that a chunk not to run. still it show how it’s applicable in case you want to save your data.\n\n#data.sample %>% write_csv(\"datasample.csv\")\n\nNow that our data are saved in our local directory, then to use it we must import in R. In importation we shall equate it as supa.\n\nsupa = read_csv(\"datasample.csv\")\n\nRows: 150 Columns: 2\n-- Column specification --------------------------------------------------------\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (1): sample\ndbl (1): value\n\ni Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\ni Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\n\nsupa %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = value, colour = sample, fill = sample))+\n  geom_density(alpha = 0.1)+\n  theme_bw()+theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank())+\n  theme(panel.grid.minor = element_blank())+\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")+theme(axis.text.x = element_text(colour = \"darkblue\", size = 10),axis.text.y = element_text(colour = \"darkblue\", size = 10),axis.title = element_text(colour = \"darkblue\", size = 13),legend.text = element_text(colour = \"darkblue\"),legend.title = element_text(colour = \"darkblue\", size = 10))\n\n\n\n\nabove figure show all sample’s result together, it is easier to present samples result in one figure, but the main purpose is to be understandable. Therefor it may be a bit harder for a viewer to understand the above figure. So in such situation we can opt to present our figure in separate samples.\n\nsupa %>% ggplot(aes(x = value, colour = sample, fill =sample))+\n  geom_density(alpha = 0.4)+ theme_bw()+\n  theme(legend.background = element_blank())+\n  facet_wrap(~sample)+\n  theme(legend.position = c(0.8,0.25),panel.grid = element_line(colour = \"white\"),axis.title = element_text(colour = \"darkblue\", size =13),axis.text = element_text(colour = \"darkblue\", size = 10),strip.background = element_rect(fill = \"lightblue\"),strip.text.x = element_text(colour = \"darkblue\", size = 10),legend.text = element_text(colour = \"darkblue\", size = 10),legend.title = element_text(colour = \"darkblue\"))\n\n\n\n\nThe above figure samples now are clearly observed. Also proves the concept that “you are in good position to get right result when you have enough sample”. Therefor you will need to consider the sample size before rushing to analysis.\n\n\nR Studio AUTO GENERATED DATA 2.\n\ntrial = iris %>% \n  as_tibble() %>% \n  janitor::clean_names() \n\n\ntrial %$% max(sepal_length, na.rm = TRUE) \n\n[1] 7.9\n\n\n\ntrial %$% min(sepal_length, na.rm = TRUE) \n\n[1] 4.3\n\n\n\ntrial %$% median(sepal_length, na.rm = TRUE) \n\n[1] 5.8\n\n\n\ntrial %$% mean(sepal_length, na.rm = TRUE) \n\n[1] 5.843333\n\n\n\ntrial.longer = iris %>% \n  as_tibble() %>% \n  janitor::clean_names() %>% \n  pivot_longer(names_to = \"variable\", values_to = \"value\", cols = 1:4)\n\n\ntrial.longer %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = species, y = value, color = variable)) +\n  geom_boxplot()\n\n\n\n\n\ntrial.longer %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = species, y = value, fill = variable)) +\n  geom_boxplot()\n\n\n\n\n\ntrial.longer %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = species, y = value, fill = variable)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  facet_wrap(~variable)\n\n\n\n\n\ntrial.longer %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = species, y = value, fill = variable)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  facet_wrap(~variable, scales = \"free_y\") +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank(),\n        panel.grid.major = element_line(linetype = \"dashed\", colour = \"grey90\"),\n        axis.text = element_text(colour = \"black\", size = 10),\n        axis.title = element_text(colour = \"black\", size = 11),\n        legend.background = element_rect(colour = \"black\", fill = NA),\n        legend.text = element_text(colour = \"black\", size = 10),\n        strip.background = element_rect(fill = NA),\n        strip.text = element_text(colour = \"black\", size = 10)) +\n  labs(x = \"Species\", y = \"Length (cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\ntrial.longer %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = species, y = value, fill = variable)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  facet_wrap(~variable, scales = \"free_y\") +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank(),\n        panel.grid.major = element_line(linetype = \"dashed\", colour = \"grey90\"),\n        axis.text = element_text(colour = \"black\", size = 10),\n        axis.title = element_text(colour = \"black\", size = 11),\n        legend.position = \"none\",\n        strip.background = element_rect(fill = \"NA\"),\n        strip.text = element_text(colour = \"black\", size = 10)) +\n  labs(x = \"Species\", y = \"Length (cm)\")\n\n\n\n\nRelated pots"

    "section": "",
    "text": "INTRODUCTION.\nI might be correct if i say you have heard about R programming language as well as many good tips concerning R experience but i want to share with you some other interesting part of R, Another good news for beginners in R language is that, in your progress toward mastering R, you will get a wonderful experience, Imagine the simplicity of preparing a single document on R editor, yet allows you to share it in multiple format such as Pdf, Word or html. Yet with R it is not an imaginations it is what it is. And good example is this post you are reading it’s also the product of R.\n\n\n\nR MIRACULOUS.\n\nCoding skills\nWriting skills\nGeneration of multiple extension from a single document\nDocument standard/visualization\nData analysis skills\nStatistical knowledge and many others.\n\nIn almost every book i read concerning R Programming, they all make you courageous and ambitious, well that is what exactly the authors want you be, so that you might start with hope. Although it is good to read, especially when you love to, in my personal experience i think is also good to have a Mentor rather than relying on Roll model(s) alone.\nI am not discouraging one from rely and spend time in books, no!, but what i am trying to advice is that, through reading or searching online contents you can find best solutions, but for beginners in R Programming Language, it is better to have someone who can take you through obstacles, someone who can spend sometimes with you, introducing obvious expected challenges and prepare you to tackle them.\n\nR Mentor vs R Roll model\nA Mentor is a person well equipped/advanced in respect of this topic (with R knowledge) a person either present in your environment or who you can have direct access to find in case you get stack or need more technique in your learning process.\nOn the other hand a Roll model is a person well equipped/advanced in R knowledge but the only help you can get from him/her is information through their writings or documentaries, though they may be usefully but also they may not solve all of your quick concerns.\n\n\n\nMODERN R.\nTo get started with R programming language, you must firstly install R and Rstudio on your computer, You might wonder, What is R and Rstudio?. Well R is a programming language and Rstudio is a working platform where you find working environment, but together provides you a great experience.\nAfter the installation of R and RStudio, then you will nee to install packages which support R and RStudio to work/function. These packages provide functions which will be required in performance of your daily activities. So once you have installed All necessary packages, come automatically with their the functions.\nTo download R, go to CRAN, the comprehensive R archive network. CRAN is composed of a set of mirror servers distributed around the world and is used to distribute R and R packages. Don’t try and pick a mirror that’s close to you: instead use the cloud mirror, https:// cloud.r-project.org, which automatically figures it out for you.\nA new major version of R comes out once a year, and there are 2–3 minor releases each year. It’s a good idea to update regularly. Upgrading can be a bit of a hassle, especially for major versions, which require you to re install all your packages, but putting it off only makes it worse.\n\n\nRStudio INSTALATION.\nRStudio is an integrated development environment, or IDE, for R programming. Download and install it from http://WWW.rstudio.com/download.\n\n\nR Package installation.\nIn R, as i have explained here above, packages are very fundamental instrument, therefor you need to install all the necessary packages before getting further. One main package is (“tidyverse”). tidyverse is an ecosystem of packages that focus on data entry, data manipulation, data modelling, data visualization(plot) and sharing of finding/insight derived from data analysis.\nInstall tidyverse through this command and any other packages as you will find fit for your own focused area.\n                         [ install.packages(\"tidyverse\") ]\nPackages in the tidyverse change fairly frequently. You can see if updates are available, and optionally install them, by running tidy verse_update().\n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION TO DATA SCIENCE IN R PROGRAMME.\nData science is a huge field, and there’s no way you can master it by reading a single book, so as i explained above it is more helpful if you get a mentor to lead you through obstacles. Also is an exciting knowledge that allows you to turn raw data into understanding, insight, and knowledge. The goal of R for Data Science is to help you to learn the most important tools in R that will allow you to do data science.\n\nData importation\nFirst you must import your data into R. This means that you take data stored in a file, database, or web API, and load it into a data frame in R first. If you can’t put your data into R, you can’t do data science on it!.\n\n\nTyding\nOnce you’ve imported your data, it is required to tidy your data. Tidying your data means storing it in a consistent form that matches the semantics of the data set with the way it is stored. In brief, when your data is tidy, each column is a variable, and each row is an observation. Tidy data is important because the consistent structure allows you to focus your struggle on questions about the data, and not fighting the data into the right form for different functions.\nOnce you have tidy data, a first step is to transform it. Transformation includes narrowing in on observations of interest eg.(all people in one city, or all data from the last year), creating new variables that are functions of existing variables Together, tidying and transforming are called wrangling, this is because, getting your data in a form that’s natural to work with often, it usually feels like a fight!.\nOnce you have tidy your data with the variables you need, there are two main engines of knowledge generation: visualization and modeling. These have complementary strengths and weaknesses, so any real analysis will iterate between them many times.\n\n\nVisualization\nVisualization is a fundamentally human activity. A good visualization will show you things that you did not expect, or raise new questions about the data. A good visualization might also hint that you’re asking the wrong question, or you need to collect different data. Visualizations can surprise you, because they require a human to interpret them.\n\n\nModels\nModels are complementary tools to visualization. Once you have made your questions sufficiently precise, you can use a model to answer them. Models are a fundamentally mathematical or computational tool, so they generally scale well. Even when they don’t, every model can make assumptions, and by its very nature a model cannot question its own assumptions. That means a model cannot fundamentally surprise you.\n\n\nCommunication\nThe last step of data science is communication, an absolutely critical part of any data analysis project. It doesn’t matter how well your models and visualization have led you to understand the data unless you can also communicate your results to others.\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n A[(Import)] --> B[Tidy]\n B --> C(Transform)\n C --> D(Visualize) \n C --> E(Model)\n D --> F{Communicate}\n E --> F\n F --> G[/HTML/]\n F --> H[/PDF/]\n F --> I[/WORD/]\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: How R programming work in analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRULES OF THE GAME IN R\nLike any other game or language, in order to perform or being grammatical correct you have to apply the correct verb for a particular tense. As well as correct action for a specific environment. The same applies to R programming language, for the better result of your data analysis you have to apply the correct package for a specific task, every package contains functions in which there are verbs that act to perform a particular task.\nThis will provides an introduction to data science and the R programming language. The goal here is to get your hands dirty right from the start!, We will walk through an entire data analysis, and along the way introduce different types of data analysis question, some fundamental programming concepts in R, and the basics of loading, cleaning, and visualizing data. we will dig into each of these steps in much more detail.\n\n\nDATA TRANSFORMATION WITH DPLYR.\nIntroduction\nVisualization is an important tool for insight generation, but it is rare that you get the data in exactly the right form you need. Often you’ll need to create some new variables or summaries, or maybe you just want to rename the variables or reorder the observations in order to make the data a little easier to work with. let’s focus on how to use the dplyr package, another core member of the tidyverse.\nThere are five key dplyr functions, which allow you to solve the vast majority of your data-manipulation challenges, These six functions, provide solutions for data manipulation.\nVERBS\n\n(filter()).\n(arrange()).\n(select()).\n(mutate()).\n(summarize()).\n(group_by()).\n\n\nFilter\nFilter is one of the verb in tidyverse which usually deals with rows(records) only in your data frame,the main thing it does is to pick observations by their volume depends on the result you intend to achieve. (==,>,<).\n\n\nSelect\nSelect is one of the verb in tidyverse which usually deals with coll um (variables) only in your table data frame,what it does is to select the variables by their names depends on the result you intend to achieve.(=).\n\n\nArrange\nArrange is one of the verb in tidyverse which usually Reorder the rows(Records) of your data frame to allow you get result you intend.\n\n\nSummarize\nSummarize is one of the verb in tidyverse which Collapse many values down to a single summary\n\n\nGroup by\nGroup by is one of the verb in tidyverse used in changes of the scope of each function from operating on the entire data frame to operating on it group-by-group.\n\n\nMutate\nMutate is one of the verb in tidyverse Create new variables with functions of existing variables.\n\nNOTE: All data frame contain Row and Column, therefore rows have to contains Records in it, while column have to contain variables in it (names). to successfully implement the above said verbs, you will have to ensure the following..\n\n\nfirstly you will have to be very clear on What kind of result you need, this depends on the questions.\nSecondly is to understand data provided before importing it to R, for analysis. (To peruse them and see if they are tidy data or messy data).\nThirdly if they are tidy, and you have already understand a question, then you need to know which kind of verb you can use to get the result. but if data are messy, then you will need to tidy them before importation or if already imported then require tidying before further steps.\n“Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.” ––- Leo Tolstoy\n“Tidy data sets are all alike, but every messy data set is messy in its own way.” ––- Hadley Wickham\n\nShortly we have several types of data type….\n\n` Character — these type of data are strings/names.\n` Double/Numeric — these type are measurable data/decimals.\n` Integer — these are numbered data/countable (0 to 9).\n` Factor — these data are categorical/level.\n` Date — Basically deal with dmy.\n\nAbbreviation\n\nint stands for integers.\ndbl stands for doubles, or real numbers.\nchr stands for character vectors, or strings.\ndttm stands for date-times (a date + a time).\n\nR provides the standard suite: >, >=, <, <=, != (not equal), and == (equal).

Data importation in R reefers to the process of calling your data from the directory (file) in your computer into the R studio where you intend to do your analysis.\n\nStep 1.\nYou have to know what kind of data you have before importing it in R. Data are usually in different extension, so you have to ensure you put your data in the right extension in your local directory. Eg. xls, csv etc…….\n\n\nStep 2.\nOn your computer open R studio, programming is usually done on console. But in the bellow demo i will work on the editor.\nProcedures.\nMy data names is (Tamisemi Primary Enrollment by Age and Sex,2021.xls”). So open a chunk then within a chunk call a required package then run the chunk. Then Open another chunk then within the chunk call your data from your local/external directory. Example, If your data are in Excel or csv extension, so i will use the package (tidyverse, read_excel and read_csv).\nhow do we call our data from our directory?\n\nread_csv(\"e:/Mystafs/blogswebsite/teneson/posts/R-introduction/BUDGET DAUDI HEALTH CENTRE 2022.csv\")\n\nNew names:\nRows: 18 Columns: 11\n-- Column specification\n-------------------------------------------------------- Delimiter: \",\" chr\n(6): TARGET, ACTIVITY, GSF CODE, Unit of measure, TOTAL, Source of Fund dbl\n(2): Quantity, frequencer num (2): unit price, ...11 lgl (1): ...10\ni Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data. i\nSpecify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n* `` -> `...10`\n* `` -> `...11`\n\n\n# A tibble: 18 x 11\n   TARGET    ACTIV~1 GSF C~2 Unit ~3 Quant~4 frequ~5 unit ~6 TOTAL Sourc~7 ...10\n   <chr>     <chr>   <chr>   <chr>     <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl> <chr> <chr>   <lgl>\n 1 Shortage~ To sup~ Medica~ Kits          6       5  1.27e4 380,~ OC      NA   \n 2 <NA>      <NA>    Drugs ~ Kits          6       5  4.23e4 1,26~ <NA>    NA   \n 3 <NA>      <NA>    Hospit~ Kits          6       5  8.45e3 253,~ <NA>    NA   \n 4 <NA>      <NA>    PPMof ~ Kits          6       5  4.23e3 126,~ <NA>    NA   \n 5 <NA>      <NA>    Dental~ Kits          6       5  8.45e3 253,~ <NA>    NA   \n 6 <NA>      <NA>    Labora~ Kits          6       5  8.45e3 253,~ <NA>    NA   \n 7 <NA>      <NA>    <NA>    <NA>         NA      NA NA      2,53~ <NA>    NA   \n 8 <NA>      To sup~ wire    metre         1       1  1.31e6 1309~ <NA>    NA   \n 9 Organiza~ To pro~ extra ~ Person        0       1  1.65e5 -     OC      NA   \n10 <NA>      <NA>    Leave ~ Person        3       1  1.2 e5 360,~ <NA>    NA   \n11 <NA>      <NA>    Medica~ Person        2       4  1   e5 800,~ <NA>    NA   \n12 <NA>      <NA>    Unifor~ Person        2       1  1.2 e5 240,~ <NA>    NA   \n13 <NA>      <NA>    Burial~ Person        2       1  1   e6 2000~ <NA>    NA   \n14 <NA>      <NA>    Statio~ Each          0       4  1.61e4 0     <NA>    NA   \n15 <NA>      <NA>    <NA>    <NA>         NA      NA NA      3,40~ <NA>    NA   \n16 <NA>      <NA>    <NA>    <NA>         NA      NA NA      7,24~ <NA>    NA   \n17 <NA>      <NA>    <NA>    <NA>         NA      NA NA      <NA>  <NA>    NA   \n18 <NA>      <NA>    <NA>    <NA>         NA      NA NA      -     <NA>    NA   \n# ... with 1 more variable: ...11 <dbl>, and abbreviated variable names\n#   1: ACTIVITY, 2: `GSF CODE`, 3: `Unit of measure`, 4: Quantity,\n#   5: frequencer, 6: `unit price`, 7: `Source of Fund`\n\n\nthe above data frame are showing the importation of data from your directory into R, using csv extension.\n\nread_xlsx(\"e:/Mystafs/blogswebsite/teneson/posts/R-introduction/BUDGET DAUDI HEALTH CENTRE 2022.xlsx\")\n\nNew names:\n* `` -> `...10`\n\n\n# A tibble: 32 x 10\n   TARGET   ACTIV~1 GSF C~2 Unit ~3 Quant~4 frequ~5 unit ~6  TOTAL Sourc~7 ...10\n   <chr>    <chr>   <chr>   <chr>     <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl>  <dbl> <chr>   <dbl>\n 1 Shortag~ To sup~ Medica~ Kits          6       5   52500 1.58e6 USER F~    NA\n 2 <NA>     <NA>    Drugs ~ Kits          6       5  175000 5.25e6 <NA>       NA\n 3 <NA>     <NA>    Hospit~ Kits          6       5   35000 1.05e6 <NA>       NA\n 4 <NA>     <NA>    PPMof ~ Kits          6       5   50000 5.25e5 <NA>       NA\n 5 <NA>     <NA>    Dental~ Kits          6       5   35000 1.05e6 <NA>       NA\n 6 <NA>     <NA>    Labora~ Kits          6       5   35000 1.05e6 <NA>       NA\n 7 <NA>     <NA>    <NA>    <NA>         NA      NA      NA 1.05e7 <NA>       NA\n 8 Organiz~ To pro~ Water ~ bills        64      12    2500 1.92e6 USER F~    NA\n 9 <NA>     <NA>    Electr~ bills      1200       6     400 2.88e6 <NA>       NA\n10 <NA>     <NA>    Per di~ person        5       5   80000 2   e6 <NA>       NA\n# ... with 22 more rows, and abbreviated variable names 1: ACTIVITY,\n#   2: `GSF CODE`, 3: `Unit of measure`, 4: Quantity, 5: frequencer,\n#   6: `unit price`, 7: `Source of Fund`\n\n\nthe above tables are showing the importation of data from your directory into R, using Xlsx extension.\nTo this stage it’s so clear that we have gain an insight on how to get started with R language and data importation ready to manipulate them and find results.

    "text": "Statistics is a branch of Maths that deals with every aspect of the data/ Also Statistics can be refereed as a knowledge for collecting, analyzing and interpreting data. Statistics can be used to predict the future, determine the probability that a specific event will happen, or help answer questions about a survey. Statistics is used in many different fields such as business, medicine, biology, psychology and social sciences.\n\n\nStatistics Leson 1.\nStatistical knowledge helps to choose the proper method of collecting data and employ those samples in the correct analysis process in order to effectively produce the results. In short, statistics is a crucial process which helps to make the decision based on the data.\nWhat is Statistics in Programming?\nIn Mathematics, statistics concerns the collection of data, organisation, interpretation, analysis and data presentation. An example of statistical analysis is when we have to determine the number of people in a town who watch TV out of the total population in the town. The small group of people is called the sample, which data is taken from them.\n\ndescriptive, which focuses on summarizing data.\nInferential, which focuses on making conclusions based on samples.\n\nInferential Statistics – Based on the data sample taken from the population, inferential statistics makes the predictions and inferences. Both types of statistics are equally employed in the field of statistical analysis..\nThe characteristics of Statistics are a:\n\nStatistics are numerically expressed.\nIt has an aggregate of facts\nData are collected in systematic order\nIt should be comparable to each other\nData are collected for a planned purpose\n\nThe importance of statistics are…\n\nStatistics helps in gathering information about the appropriate quantitative data\nIt depicts the complex data in graphical form, tabular form and in diagrammatic representation to understand it easily\nIt provides the exact description and a better understanding\nIt helps in designing the effective and proper planning of the statistical inquiry in any field\nIt gives valid inferences with the reliability measures about the population parameters from the sample data\nIt helps to understand the variability pattern through the quantitative observations\n\nWhy is statistics vital?\nStatistics is an important field because it helps us understand the general trends and patterns in a given data set. Statistics can be used for analyzing data and drawing conclusions from it. It can also be used for making predictions about future events and behaviors. Statistics also help us understand how things are changing over time.\nThe main purpose of using statistics is to plan the collected data in terms of experimental designs and statistical surveys. Statistics is considered a mathematical science that works with numerical data.\nWhat are the uses of statistics in real life?\nStatistics is an integral part of our lives. It is used in the workplace and everyday life. In the workplace, statistics are often used to analyse what works best for a company’s marketing strategy or how to distribute work among employees. In daily life, statistics can be used to analyse what food you should buy at the grocery store or how much money you spend on purchasing each week. Statistics are everywhere, and they help us make sense of the world around us.\nConcept covered in Statistics.\nThe most important concepts covered in Statistics include - mean, - median - mode - range\n- standard deviation - Normality and - Significance.\nMean and Median in statistics usually measure the median/mean value, but their application depend on the sample’s nature.\n\n\nDescriptive Statistics.\nDescriptive statistics usually used to describe type of data, by describe Median, Mean, Mode and Range in a particular data.\n\nThe mean is the average of the data set.\nThe median is the middle of the set of numbers.\nThe mode is the most common number in a data set.\n\nIn these three the mean is the only one that requires formula. Mean in math is what called Average, they are synonym.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to find Median.\n\n\n\nTo calculate median value when your data values are mostly alike but some few values have big difference from the other either High or Low. The purpose is to avoid the high or low values to affect the result. Basically for numeric data.\n(1,2,3,4,5,6,7) to find median ……. you arrange your numbers from the lowest to the highest or from highest to the lowest then you pick the centered number. So in the set 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 the middle number is 4.\nBut what happens if the data set is like (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8)? in that case you arrange your data set and then you add the two middle numbers and then you them divide by 2, (4 + 5 = 9/2 = 4.5).\nIn most cases the median and the mean are likely to have the same value, even when they differ, it’s not in significance gap.\n\nHow to find mean.\nThere are mainly two ways to find mean in a data set, One is by finding the sum of the values by adding them all up, dividing the sum by the number of values in the data set.\nEg. (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) to find mean …… 1 + 2+ 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7= 28/7 = 4 therefor the mean is 4. Remember the mean in a data set does not have to appear in the data set.**\n\n\n\n\nThe different between Mean and Median\n\nThe median is less affected by outliers and skewed data, is used for skewed distributions.\nMedian is Usually the preferred measure of central tendency, when distribution is not symmetrical.\nThe mean is usually used for normal distributed data.\n\nStandard deviation\n\nYou have to calculate the deviation in order to measure where your data deviate from the normal value.\n\n\n\n\nStatistics lesson 2.\nAs we have seen in previous lesson, statistics plays major roll to daily life activities, therefor knowing how to apply statistics in analysis, is not only basic knowledge to acquire but also essential tool to approach and solve some analytic data based questions.\nSo in this lesson we shall focus on the second type of statistics, which often used to transform, analyze and give analytic results, to support decision making. Inferential statistics help to solve many problems which require analytics approach, and scientific based evidence. So if you want to become a data analyst or a good researcher, then this angle is where you should focus attentively.\n\n\nInferential Statistics for numeric data.\nWhile descriptive statistics used to describe type of data, and describe Median, Mean, Mode and Range in a particular data. Then Inferential statistics focus on solutions, or in other word, when Data rise challenges or questions, it’s inferential type of statistic which solve and answer those challenges and questions.\n\n\nData collection theory.\nBegin with sample collection, it is advise to collect at least 10 to 30 percent samples of general population, this is to ensure samples can provide accurate results. This is due to fact that, the less ample you collect the less efficient result you may get, also the more sample you collect might be unnecessary sometimes, this means it might not make any different in results. So it is advice to collect a reasonable sample size for better utilization of resources and time management.\n\n\nHypothesis Theory.\nHypothesis means the basic assumptions rouse by a researcher or a data annalist, which support or give reasons for Him/Her to conduct a research, or to collect a particular data to clear His/Her doubt. So every researcher always have most common expected result in His/Her assumptions, But whatever results which are assumed to be true or false, are what called Hypothesis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are two types Hypothesis.\n\nNull Hypothesis – Ho – Negative.\nAlternative Hypothesis – Ha – Positive\n\n\n\n\nOften data are collected by researcher(s), who focus on a specific matter or subject, So there are some steps to consider before going field for data collection. Begin by setting your project plan, including project tile and objectives, then finally to rise hypothesis. Now in professional standard, the Hypothesis which used to finalize the research conclusions is Null Hypothesis – Ho – Negative.\nIn statistic analysis, we use different approach to address solutions to our questions, A requires standard approach in statistical analysis, is to test the significance and Insignificance of the data results, and the normality of data distributions. Therefor to be sure about data conclusions, then you have to test data normality, and the significance and Insignificance of the results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest significance and Insignificance.\n\n\n\n\nNull hypothesis theory = No significant difference.\nAlternative Hypothesis Theory = There is significant difference.\n\n\n\nNull hypothesis theory, is usually used to conclude results of the research, and to measure the significance of the results, as well as to measure the normality of data distributions, so many research conclusions are made by using this theory. So the significant level and Normality both are measured by P value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormula to measure significance of data results.\n\n\n\nIn the case of measuring significance of the results we refer to the formula that…\n\nwhen the P value = > 0.05 then it’s considered There is No significant difference. And\nwhen the P value = < 0.05 then it’s considered There is significant difference.\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Normality Formula.\n\nNull Hypothesis - Ho = Is normal distributed. while\nAlternative Hypothesis - Ha = Is not normal distributed.\n\nNormality refers to the distribution of your collected data, this means after you have describe your data in descriptive type of statistics, then you have to test them, if they are normal distributed or not normal distributed. In normality formula we prescribe the P level formula other way round, which means,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNormality formula.\n\n\n\nIn the case of measuring normality of data distributions we refer to the formula that…\n\nWhen P value = > 0.05 then you Accept the Null.\nWhen P value = < 0.05 then you Reject the Null.\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Normality in R.\nIn R, we test the distributions of the data by using the function (shapiro), the below example is how you can test the distribution of the data in R analysis. The data we are using is auto generated from R data base. In R you can find some data to help you improve your analysis practice, in case you don’t have access to acquire data from other source. to generate data in R, just create a chunk then write iris then run the chunk, and data will appear on your R editor. After that you can equate them to another name.\n\nrequire(tidyverse)\n\nLoading required package: tidyverse\n\n\n-- Attaching core tidyverse packages ------------------------ tidyverse 2.0.0 --\nv dplyr     1.1.0     v readr     2.1.4\nv forcats   1.0.0     v stringr   1.5.0\nv ggplot2   3.4.1     v tibble    3.1.8\nv lubridate 1.9.2     v tidyr     1.3.0\nv purrr     1.0.1     \n-- Conflicts ------------------------------------------ tidyverse_conflicts() --\nx dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\nx dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\ni Use the conflicted package (<http://conflicted.r-lib.org/>) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\n\n\nsample.iris=iris\n\n\nsample.iris$Sepal.Length %>%  shapiro.test()\n\n\n    Shapiro-Wilk normality test\n\ndata:  .\nW = 0.97609, p-value = 0.01018\n\n\n\nggplot(data = sample.iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length))+\n  geom_density(fill = \"darkred\",alpha = 0.3)+\n  theme_bw()+\n   theme(panel.grid.major.x = element_line(color = \"lightgrey\", linetype = \"dashed\"), panel.grid.major.y = element_line(color = \"lightgrey\", linetype = \"dashed\"), panel.grid = element_line(color = \"white\"), axis.title = element_text(color = \"darkred\", size = 12), axis.text = element_text(color = \"darkred\"), axis.line.x = element_line(linewidth = 1), axis.line.y = element_line(linewidth = 1))\n\n\n\n\nwe have tested Sepal.L data normality in R, and results shows that they are not normal distributed. Then we have tried to plot in order to observe visual distribution, and results still shows that Sepal.Length are not normal distributed.\n\nsample.iris$Sepal.Width %>% shapiro.test()\n\n\n    Shapiro-Wilk normality test\n\ndata:  .\nW = 0.98492, p-value = 0.1012\n\n\n\nggplot(data = sample.iris, aes(x = Sepal.Width))+\n  geom_density(fill=\"darkred\",alpha = 0.3)+\n  theme_bw()+\n  theme(panel.grid.major.x = element_line(color = \"lightgrey\", linetype = \"dashed\"), panel.grid.major.y = element_line(color = \"lightgrey\", linetype = \"dashed\"), panel.grid = element_line(color = \"white\"), axis.title = element_text(color = \"darkred\", size = 12), axis.text = element_text(color = \"darkred\"), axis.line.x = element_line(linewidth = 1), axis.line.y = element_line(linewidth = 1))\n\n\n\n\nwe have tested Sepal.Width data normality in R, and results shows that they are normal distributed. Then we have tried to plot in order to observe visual distribution, and results still shows that Sepal.Width are normal distributed.\nThis is how we test data in R programming language, it is easier and clear as we have seen. S o working your data in R, is not only a recommended tool but also facilitate mass data solutions.\n\n\nCENTRAL LIMIT THEORY (CLT)\nIn statistics the central limit theory means the value on which majority of population falls. It simply states that The distribution approaches normal, as the samples get larger. therefor it is recommended that to attain doubtless results you are required to collect at least >/= of 30% samples of the population.\nThis theory of central limit usually shown through continuous plots such as Histogram and density. This is due to their nature. On the figure below we are going to see the example of central limit theory in visualization.\nIn this study we will see how statistics works in real life, and how useful it is in every day’s decision making. By applying a proper and correct method in collecting/recording samples, analyzing, interpreting and sharing of findings is always a best way to reach the right decisions, especially for decision makers, weather in family level.\n\nWhat is the purpose of dispersion\nThe purpose is to find out how spread out the data values are, on the number line, the deference between the maximum and the minimum value is the formula to measure dispersion (Measure of spread).\n\n\nWhat does it mean by Measure of central tendency\nSimply is defined as A measure that identifies a single value as representative of the entire distribution. It is the single value that is most typical/representative of the collected data.\nRelated pots"

By saying i was only relying on books i don’t mean one should not rely on books, but what i am trying to encourage is that, there millions of relevant online free source solutions, that may get you out of your dark vision and become enlightened.\nSoft skills basically means additional knowledge you acquire through different methods including online open source, always soft skills are more relevant for solutions to the current community challenges, also keep you up to date with rapid change of the modern tech. Therefor there no excuses for self knowledge at individual level, as long as there enough contributors with readiness to held you from your angle of interest.\nHaving share my personal experience, today i want to share with you one of the ways to store your soft properties online, i write this because many of us have many ideas as well as soft properties on our computers, but don’t know where to store them safely and they get lost we stand looser with no backup means.

    "section": "",
    "text": "ON GOING PROCEDURES.\nTAMISEMI Procedures to follow by a public servant when request to shift from one Municipal to another Municipal for any reasonable ground(s). In this post you will see the current system by which a public servant should get prepared to undergo during the process. Remember The process is usual performed by the Local Government officials. this means a public servant’s roll is only to initiate the process by filling his/her request, and after the submission of document at DED’S OFFICE, of his/her working station, then the public servant has no more roll to the rest of the process until it’s done.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TB\n  A(Public </br> Servant) -- MOI -- DMO -- DED -- 1st --> B[DED </br>New Municipal]\n  B -- 2nd --> C[DED </br>Current Municipal]\n  C -- 3rd --> D[RAS </br>Current region]\n  D -- 4th --> E{CS </br>TAMISEMI For approvall}\n  E -- 5th --> F[(CS </br>UTUMISHI for execution)]\n  F -- 6th --> C\n  C -- 7th --> A \n  A -- REPORT--> B \n  B -- DED --8th --> F\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The current procedural system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTIONS OF THE CURENT PROCESS.\nStep 1.\nAs we can see the above chart, the process begins with the “Request latter for a vacancy” from a public servant to a DED of the Municipal he/she want to go, but this latter must pass through Medical officer In charge (MOI), District Medical Officer (DMO)and District Executive Director (DED) of his/her current work station, for authorization.\nStep 2.\nDistrict Executive Director (DED) of a current work station, shall authorize the latter and send it to the DED of the Municipal that the public servant want to go and that latter shall go through Medical officer In charge (DMO) of that new Municipal for confirmation of vacancy in health department.\nStep 3.\nDED of the Municipal that the public servant want to shift to, shall confirm request latter and write a confirmation latter to a public servant through current Municipal DED for further procedures.\nStep 4.\nDistrict Executive Director (DED) of a current work station, shall write to a current Regional Administration Secretary (RAS), to notify the provision of a vacancy as well as asking to proceed the process to the Ministry level (TAMISEMI), after that, the Ras office shall write to Tamisemi’s Cabinet Secretary (CS) to approve the request.\nStep 5.\nTamisemi’s CS shall approve and send the letter to CS responsible for PUBLIC SERVICE for Execution. After the process is done at Utumishi, the UTUMISHI’s CS shall send a Permission latter to both a Municipal Council of the current working station through DED.\nStep 6.\nDistrict Executive Director (DED) of s current work station, shall write a release latter to a public servant to grant a movement permit to a new Municipal, attach his latter with the latter from Utumishi’s CS, which shows the requirement to be done soon after reporting to a new Municipal.\nStep 7.\nThe last step is the Public servant to report to the New working station, this is done after receiving the permission latter from Both Utumishi and DED. Soon after his/her report the public servant is required to inform the Utumishi CS through New Municipal DED, that a servant has reported to his new work station.\n\n\nADVANTAGES OF THE CURRENT PROCESS.\nTo begin with the current process, is absolutely fit to the government’s concept of preserving its documents. Preservation of government’s document is very important in order to avoid linkage of classified information. Therefor the Public Servant’s information is of one of the very important document to both government and Servant.\nIn addition to that, the current process offers great chance to the Government’s department to measure and crosscheck the validity and legality of the process, this method helps officials not to work under pressure of pushing things without close observation.\nFurthermore, the current process support the system of governance to keep working normal while it’s in execution. this helps to not frustrate the working shifts at work palaces, as well as extra cost that can be spend by the Public servant during the process.\nMoreover, the current process cutoff corruption attempt during the process, because the document shall go under the very systematic stages before its approval, during this process no one can absolutely know who to deal with or who to cooperate with to speedup of maneuver the process.\nIn conclusion, the current process saves government’s money (Public Servant’s Transfer payment), since the Servant shall bear the whole transfer expenses him/her self.\n\n\nDISADVANTAGES OF THE CURRENT PROCESS.\n\nTime and material cost; this is due to fact that a public servant need to bear some material cost when shifting even if sometimes there are genuine reasons for his/her request\nBureaucracy; this is due to fact that, the latter fo permission to shift is passing through people’s hands, so it is possible to be blocked somewhere within a chain of process.\nCheating; this is due to fact that , there no roll a public servant can play legally to speed up the process, so some unfaithful servant within the administration can make some deliberate mistake to frustrate/sabot the process.\nLess efficiency; this is due to fact that, a public servant must concentrate much of his/her time to seek feedback of for followup of his/her request, this reduces concentration to work.\n\n\n\nPROPOSED PROCEDURES.\nAlthough there are many advantages and some disadvantages on the current shifting process, there few things must be taken into consideration as we move forward, we must put in place some useful measures to improve the current system.\n\nIntegration of online system.\nthis method can improve the system in many ways such as, Unnecessary delay of report, Cost during the process, simplifying the feedback to both A public servant as well as Municipal authority, Easy method to be accessed by the whole chain in government sectors. This type of system will also reduces the possibility of lost of document during the process.\n\n\nServant’s Account.\nEvery public servant shall be required to have a Government service account, which will be accessible via his/her cheq number as a passcode, employee account shall be accessible by both all above authorities of the Local Government Ministry, Servant to CS, also a servant shall use that account for three main reasons.\n\nTo file Leave letters\nTo claim servant’s rights at work as well as social rights at work places.\nTo file transfer and shift letters and similar reports.\n\n\n\nDiscouragement of a personal choice.\nthe current method allows a public servant to seek a vacancy directly to a specific Municipal, but sometimes this may cause one to cooperate with another administrator to get chance in that Municipal , here is when you can smell corruption, So to tackle this i suggest that, Tamisemi after reception of a shifting latter from RAC office, it must play a roll to decide as follow.\nWhen a servant request for a vacancy, shall propose three Municipal he/she wants to shift to, then shall be a roll of TAMISEMI to decide the Municipal in which a servant shall go. this is due to fact that, some of Municipal have insufficiency workers while others have enough and sometimes excess.\nTherefor every letter together with all necessary supportive documents shall be filled online through that employee account, and it will be accessible by MOI, DMO and DED. After all mention authorities approval to that online form, then a servant shall push that form to TAMISEMI through RAS’s office. Ras’s office shall for determine the legality and legitimacy of the mentioned grounds for transfer/shift.\nTamisemi shall directly notify a New Municipal DED on the shifting process of a servant, as well as determine weather it is reasonable to pay for his or her shift.\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TB\n  A(Servant </br>Application) -- MOI -- DMO -- DED -- 1st--> B[Ras]\n  B -- 2nd--> C{CS </br>Tamisemi}\n  C -- 3rd --> D[(CS</br>UTUMISHI)]\n  D -- 4TH --> A\n  D --> E[New municipal]\n  A -- Report -->E\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: The proposed procedural system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nADVANTAGES OF THE PROCESS.\n\nThis process will provede a transparency and a room for a servant to followup the progress of his/her request directly, and if any query/comment will be raise from the above authority, a servant will be able to answer or fulfill whatever requirement(s) that has been raised through the same platform.\nOnline submission shall make transparent to the whole system of Government, and during the process every part shall be able to track where the process is being slowed and for what reason. This process will make an end to the age of lamentation or doubt from many public servants on senior government officials."
