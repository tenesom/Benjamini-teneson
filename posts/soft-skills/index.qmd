## Soft skills.

Talking of soft skills, remind me of my past few years when i was total unaware of online contents and some staffs like Google, i am saying this intentionally because it was so hard for me to search for solutions to my disturbing questions on Google or other online platforms. This held me to remain with what i learned from books or at school  only, i was in the mid of tech solutions but not benefiting from it at all. By saying i was only relying on books i don't mean one should not rely on books, but what i am trying to encourage is that, there millions of relevant online free source solutions, that may get you out of your dark vision and become enlightened. 

Soft skills basically means additional knowledge you acquire through different methods including online open source, always soft skills are more relevant for solutions to the current community challenges, also keep you up to date with rapid change of the modern tech. Therefor there no excuses for self knowledge at individual level, as long as there enough contributors with readiness to held you from your angle of interest.

Today's lesson can help you to safe store your writings ideas and findings.

## About GitHub.

## Procedures to push properties to GitHub repository.

Before proceeding to steps to push your properties to **GitHub** Firstly make sure folders are well arranged on your local repository (Computer). This means you need to ensure all the necessary folders you plan to push them to GitHub are in the same folder. Also avoid putting space in your folder's name(s), this is due to fact that programming doesn't cop well with spaces.

You can arrange folders in your computer in **(My_computer/local disc e/github_files/specific folder.).** This will help you find your folder easier on **GitBash.**  For example in my local directory my properties are in **local disc e/my_properties/teneson ),** therefor my first and second command lines on GitBash shall begin with **<cd e:, then cd/my_properties/teneson>**,

## Command lines at first commit.

Here below, the first and second lines here under, are examples due to my folders arrangement in my computer, so you as well shall write depending on the folder arrangement on your computer. But from **line 3 to 7, shall be written as they are, only during the first commit to GitHub. Line 5, within a quotation marks, you are advised to write a comment message concerning your properties.** 

Open the GitBash then write the following command lines. 

- cd e:
- cd e/my_properties/teneson
- **git init**
- **git add .** 
- **git commit -m "comment"**
- **git remote add origin**
- **git push -u origin main**

## Command lines at second+ commit.

The first and second lines here under, are examples due to my folders arrangement in my computer, so you should not refer to them exactly as they are, instead you shall write depending on the folder arrangement on your computer. But from **line 3 to 5, should be written as they are, only during the first commit to GitHub.
