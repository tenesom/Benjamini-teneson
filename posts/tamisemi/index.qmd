### DESCRIPTIONS OF THE CURENT PROCESS.

**Step 1.**

As we can see the above chart, the process begins with the **"Request latter for a vacancy"** from a public servant to a **DED** of the Municipal he/she want to go, but this latter must pass through Medical officer In charge **(MOI)**, District Medical Officer **(DMO**)and District Executive Director **(DED)** of his/her current work station, for authorization.

**Step 2.**

District Executive Director **(DED)** of a current work station, shall authorize the latter and send it to the **DED** of the Municipal that the public servant want to go and that latter shall go through Medical officer In charge **(DMO)** of that new Municipal for confirmation of vacancy in health department.

**Step 3.**

**DED** of the Municipal that the public servant want to shift to, shall confirm request latter and write a confirmation latter to a public servant through current Municipal **DED** for further procedures.

**Step 4.**

District Executive Director **(DED)** of a current work station, shall write to a current Regional Administration Secretary **(RAS),** to notify the provision of a vacancy as well as asking to proceed the process to the Ministry level **(TAMISEMI)**, after that, the **Ras** office shall write to Tamisemi's Cabinet Secretary **(CS)** to approve the request.

**Step 5.**

Tamisemi's **CS** shall approve and send the letter to **CS** responsible for PUBLIC SERVICE for Execution. After the process is done at Utumishi, the **UTUMISHI's CS** shall send a Permission latter to both a Municipal Council of the current working station through **DED.**

**Step 6.**

District Executive Director **(DED)** of s current work station, shall write a **release latter to a public servant to grant a movement permit to a new Municipal,** attach his latter with the latter from **Utumishi's CS,** which shows the requirement to be done soon after reporting to a new Municipal.

**Step 7.**

The last step is the Public servant to report to the New working station, this is done after receiving the permission latter from Both Utumishi and DED. Soon after his/her report the public servant is required to inform the **Utumishi CS** through **New Municipal DED**, that a servant has reported to his new work station.

### ADVANTAGES OF THE CURRENT PROCESS.

To begin with the current process, is absolutely fit to the government's concept of preserving its documents. Preservation of government's document is very important in order to avoid linkage of classified information. Therefor the Public Servant's information is of one of the very important document to both government and Servant.

In addition to that, the current process offers great chance to the Government's department to measure and crosscheck the validity and legality of the process, this method helps officials not to work under pressure of pushing things without close observation.

Furthermore, the current process support the system of governance to keep working normal while it's in execution. this helps to not frustrate the working shifts at work palaces, as well as extra cost that can be spend by the Public servant during the process.

Moreover, the current process cutoff corruption attempt during the process, because the document shall go under the very systematic stages before its approval, during this process no one can absolutely know who to deal with or who to cooperate with to speedup of maneuver the process.

In conclusion, the current process saves government's money (Public Servant's Transfer payment), since the Servant shall bear the whole transfer expenses him/her self.

### DISADVANTAGES OF THE CURRENT PROCESS.

- **Time and material cost;** this is due to fact that a public servant need to bear some material cost when shifting even if sometimes there are genuine reasons for his/her request

- **Bureaucracy;** this is due to fact that, the latter fo permission to shift is passing through people's hands, so it is possible to be blocked somewhere within a chain of process.

- **Cheating;** this is due to fact that , there no roll a public servant can play legally to speed up the process, so some unfaithful servant within the administration can make some deliberate mistake to frustrate/sabot the process.

- **Less efficiency;** this is due to fact that, a public servant must concentrate much of his/her time to seek feedback of for followup of his/her request, this reduces concentration to work.

### PROPOSED PROCEDURES.

Although there are many advantages and some disadvantages on the current shifting process, there few things must be taken into consideration as we move forward, we must put in place some useful measures to improve the current system.

#### Integration of online system.

this method can improve the system in many ways such as, Unnecessary delay of report, Cost during the process, simplifying the feedback to both A public servant as well as Municipal authority, Easy method to be accessed by the whole chain in government sectors. This type of system will also reduces the possibility of lost of document during the process.

#### Servant's Account. 

Every public servant shall be required to have a Government service account, which will be accessible via his/her cheq number as a passcode, employee account shall be accessible by both all above authorities of the Local Government Ministry, **Servant to CS,** also a servant shall use that account for three main reasons.

- To file Leave letters

- To claim servant's rights at work as well as social rights at work places.

- To file transfer and shift letters and similar reports.


#### Discouragement of a personal choice.

the current method allows a public servant to seek a vacancy directly to a specific Municipal, but sometimes this may cause one to cooperate with another administrator to get chance in that Municipal , here is when you can smell corruption, So to tackle this i suggest that, Tamisemi after reception of a shifting latter from RAC office, it must play a roll to decide as follow.

When a servant request for a vacancy, shall propose three Municipal he/she wants to shift to, then shall be a roll of **TAMISEMI** to decide the Municipal in which a servant shall go. this is due to fact that, some of Municipal have insufficiency workers while others have enough and sometimes excess.

Therefor every letter together with all necessary supportive documents shall be filled **online** through that employee account, and it will be accessible by **MOI**, **DMO** and **DED**. After all mention authorities approval to that online form, then a servant shall push that form to **TAMISEMI** through **RAS's office.** Ras's office shall for determine the legality and legitimacy of the mentioned grounds for transfer/shift.

Tamisemi shall directly notify a New Municipal DED on the shifting process of a servant, as well as determine weather it is reasonable to pay for his or her shift.

### ADVANTAGES OF THE PROCESS.

- This process will provede a transparency and a room for a servant to followup the progress of his/her request directly, and if any query/comment will be raise from the above authority, a servant will be able to answer or fulfill whatever requirement(s) that has been raised through the same platform. 

- Online submission shall make transparent to the whole system of Government, and during the process every part shall be able to track where the process is being slowed and for what reason. This process will make an end to the age of lamentation or doubt from many public servants on senior government officials.
