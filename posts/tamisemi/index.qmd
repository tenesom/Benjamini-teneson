### DESCRIPTIONS OF THE CURENT PROCESS.

::: columns
:::: {.column width="50%"}

The following are the steps that a public servant must follow when seeking to transfer from one municipality to another municipality. These procedures are typically handled by local government officials. It is important to note that the public servant initiates the process and after submitting the required documents at the DED's (District Executive Director) office, they do not have any further involvement until the process is completed.  Due to the government's reliance on a manual process server system, primarily utilizing the Post Office for document delivery, it may take some time for the process to be completed.

### procedures.

**Step 1.**

The process starts with the public servant submitting a "Request Letter for a Vacancy" to the District Executive Director (DED) of the Municipal they wish to transfer to. It is important to note that this letter must first go through the officer in charge of the servant's department and then to the District Executive Director (DED) of the servant's current Municipal for authorization.

**Step 4.**

After receiving the confirmation letter, the District Executive Director (DED) of the servant's current Municipal will write to the Regional Administration Secretary (RAS) to inform them about the availability of a vacancy. The DED will request the RAS to initiate the process and forward it to the Ministry of State, President's Office, Regional Administration and Local Government (TAMISEMI). Subsequently, the RAS office will write to the Cabinet Secretary (CS) of TAMISEMI to seek approval for the process.

**Step 2.**

The District Executive Director of the servant's current work station will authorize the letter and send it to the DED of the Municipal that the servant wishes to transfer to.The same process will be followed at the new Municipal. This means that the letter will be forwarded to the officer in charge of the department to confirm the availability of a vacancy, and then proceed to the DED's office.

**Step 5.**

The Cabinet Secretary (CS) for TAMISEMI will review and approve the letter, subsequently forwarding it to the Cabinet Secretary responsible for the Public Service for execution. Once the process is completed at the Public Service Commission (Utumishi), the Permission Letter will be sent by Utumishi (CS) to both the public servant through the DED of their current working station and to the DED of the new Municipal Council.

**Step 3.**

Upon receiving and confirming the request, the District Executive Director (DED) of the Municipal that the public servant wishes to transfer to will write a confirmation letter regarding the provision of the vacancy. This letter will be sent back to the public servant through their District Executive Director (DED) to initiate further shifting procedures that will be undertaken by the current DED's office.

**Step 6.**

The District Executive Director (DED) of the servant's current work station will write a permission letter granting approval for the public servant to transfer. This permission letter will be attached to the letter received from the Cabinet Secretary of Utumishi that outlines the requirements to be fulfilled upon reporting to the new Municipal.

**Step 7.**

The final step is for the public servant to report to their new working station. This can only be done after receiving the movement permission letter from the District Executive Director (DED) and completing the handover process at their current work station. Upon reporting to the new municipal, the public servant is required to inform the Cabinet Secretary of Utumishi through the DED of the new municipal about their arrival and commencement of duties.

### ADVANTAGES OF THE CURRENT PROCESS.


- Document Preservation: The current process aligns with the government's objective of preserving its documents. By following a systematic and regulated procedure, the government ensures the preservation of important information and avoids the risk of exposing classified data.

- Validity and Legality Checks: The current process provides an opportunity for government departments to measure and crosscheck the validity and legality of the transfer. This ensures that officials do not rush or compromise the process and allows for careful observation and assessment.

- Smooth Workflow: The current process allows the government to maintain normal workflow during the execution of the transfer. This helps in avoiding disruptions to work schedules and minimizes additional costs that may arise from the transfer process.

- Curbing Corruption: The structured stages of the current process act as a deterrent to corruption attempts. As the document progresses through various levels of approval, it becomes difficult for any individual to manipulate or expedite the process through unauthorized means.

- Cost Savings: One notable advantage of the current process is that it saves government money. Public servants bear the entire cost of their own transfer expenses, reducing the financial burden on the government.

### DISADVANTAGES OF THE CURRENT PROCESS.

::: columns
:::: {.column width="50%"}

- Time and Material Cost: The current process imposes time and material costs on the public servant. Even if there are genuine reasons for the request to transfer, the burden of bearing the costs associated with the relocation falls on the individual. This can create financial strain and inconvenience for the public servant.

::: 
:::: {.column width="50%"}

- Bureaucracy: The current process involves the passage of the permission letter through multiple individuals and departments. This bureaucratic nature of the process increases the risk of delays and potential blockages within the chain of process. It can lead to inefficiencies and prolong the time taken to complete the transfer.

::: 
:::: 

- Reduced Efficiency: The current process requires the public servant to dedicate a significant amount of time and effort in seeking feedback or following up on their transfer request. This diversion of attention from their regular work responsibilities can result in decreased efficiency and productivity.

- Cheating can occur when an unscrupulous public servant intentionally makes mistakes or engages in acts of sabotage within the administration, as there are no legal roles they can fulfill to expedite the process.

### PROPOSED PROCEDURES.

While evaluating the current shifting process, it is important to consider several factors as we look to improve the system. To enhance efficiency, we should implement the following measures:

::: columns

### Integration of an online system.

By introducing an online system, we can address various issues associated with the current process. This includes reducing unnecessary delays in reporting, minimizing costs, facilitating feedback between public servants and municipal authorities, and providing easy access for government sectors. Additionally, the online system will help minimize the risk of document loss during the process.

### Servant's Account.

Each public servant should be required to have a government service account, accessible using their cheq number as a passcode. This account will serve three main purposes:

- Filing leave letters.
- Claiming rights and benefits at the workplace, both social and professional.
- Submitting transfer letters, and similar reports.

### Discouragement of personal choice.

Currently, public servants can directly seek vacancies in specific municipalities, potentially leading to corruption through collusion with administrators. To address this issue, TAMISEMI (the Ministry of Local Government) should play a role in deciding the municipality to which a servant will be assigned. When a servant requests a vacancy, they should propose three preferred municipalities, leaving the decision to TAMISEMI. This ensures fairness and considers the varying workforce needs of different municipalities.

### The proposed procedures offer several advantages

Transparency and direct follow-up: The process will provide transparency, allowing servants to track the progress of their requests. If there are any queries or comments from the relevant authorities, servants can respond and fulfill the requirements through the same online platform.

Enhanced transparency and accountability: Online submission will ensure transparency throughout the government system. Every stage of the process can be tracked, identifying any slowdowns or reasons for delays. This will help alleviate concerns or doubts among public servants regarding senior government officials.
