Statistics can be used to predict the\nfuture, determine the probability that a specific event will happen, or\nhelp answer questions about a survey. Statistics is used in many\ndifferent fields such as business, medicine, biology, psychology and\nsocial sciences.\n\n![](control-.jpg)\n\n### Statistics Leson 1.\n\nStatistical knowledge helps to choose the proper method of collecting\ndata and employ those samples in the correct analysis process in order\nto effectively produce the results. In short, statistics is a crucial\nprocess which helps to make the decision based on the data.\n\n**What is Statistics in Programming?**\n\nIn Mathematics, statistics concerns the collection of data,\norganisation, interpretation, analysis and data presentation. An example\nof statistical analysis is when we have to determine the number of\npeople in a town who watch TV out of the total population in the town.\nThe small group of people is called the sample, which data is taken from\nthem.\n\n-   **descriptive, which focuses on summarizing data.**\n-   **Inferential, which focuses on making conclusions based on\n    samples.**\n\nInferential Statistics -- Based on the data sample taken from the\npopulation, inferential statistics makes the predictions and inferences.\nBoth types of statistics are equally employed in the field of\nstatistical analysis..\n\n**The characteristics of Statistics are a:**\n\n-   Statistics are numerically expressed.\n-   It has an aggregate of facts\n-   Data are collected in systematic order\n-   It should be comparable to each other\n-   Data are collected for a planned purpose\n\n**The importance of statistics are...**\n\n-   Statistics helps in gathering information about the appropriate\n    quantitative data\n-   It depicts the complex data in graphical form, tabular form and in\n    diagrammatic representation to understand it easily\n-   It provides the exact description and a better understanding\n-   It helps in designing the effective and proper planning of the\n    statistical inquiry in any field\n-   It gives valid inferences with the reliability measures about the\n    population parameters from the sample data\n-   It helps to understand the variability pattern through the\n    quantitative observations\n\n**Why is statistics vital?**\n\nStatistics is an important field because it helps us understand the\ngeneral trends and patterns in a given data set. Statistics can be used\nfor analyzing data and drawing conclusions from it. It can also be used\nfor making predictions about future events and behaviors. Statistics\nalso help us understand how things are changing over time.\n\nThe main purpose of using statistics is to plan the collected data in\nterms of experimental designs and statistical surveys. Statistics is\nconsidered a mathematical science that works with numerical data.\n\n**What are the uses of statistics in real life?**\n\nStatistics is an integral part of our lives. It is used in the workplace\nand everyday life. In the workplace, statistics are often used to\nanalyse what works best for a company's marketing strategy or how to\ndistribute work among employees. In daily life, statistics can be used\nto analyse what food you should buy at the grocery store or how much\nmoney you spend on purchasing each week. Statistics are everywhere, and\nthey help us make sense of the world around us.\n\n**Concept covered in Statistics.**\n\nThe most important concepts covered in Statistics include - mean, -\nmedian - mode - range\\\n- standard deviation - Normality and - Significance.\n\nMean and Median in statistics usually measure the median/mean value, but\ntheir application depend on the sample's nature.\n\n### Descriptive Statistics.\n\nDescriptive statistics usually used to describe type of data, by\ndescribe Median, Mean, Mode and Range in a particular data.\n\n1.  **The mean is the average of the data set.**\n2.  **The median is the middle of the set of numbers.**\n3.  **The mode is the most common number in a data set.**\n\nIn these three the mean is the only one that requires formula. Mean in\nmath is what called Average, they are synonym.\n\n::: callout\n#### How to find Median.\n\nTo calculate median value when your data values are mostly alike but\nsome few values have big difference from the other either High or Low.\nThe purpose is to avoid the high or low values to affect the result.\nBasically for numeric data.\n\n(1,2,3,4,5,6,7) to find median ....... you arrange your numbers from\nthe lowest to the highest or from highest to the lowest then you pick\nthe centered number. So in the set 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 the middle number\nis 4.\n\nBut what happens if the data set is like (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8)? in\nthat case you arrange your data set and then you add the two middle\nnumbers and then you them divide by 2, (4 + 5 = 9/2 = 4.5).\n\nIn most cases the median and the mean are likely to have the same value,\neven when they differ, it's not in significance gap.\n\n#### How to find mean.\n\nThere are mainly two ways to find mean in a data set, One is by finding\nthe sum of the values by adding them all up, dividing the sum by the\nnumber of values in the data set.\n\nEg. (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) to find mean ...... 1 + 2+ 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 +\n7= 28/7 = 4 therefor the mean is 4. Remember the mean in a data set does\nnot have to appear in the data set.**\n:::\n\n#### The different between Mean and Median\n\n1.  The median is less affected by outliers and skewed data, is used for\n    skewed distributions.\n2.  Median is Usually the preferred measure of central tendency, when\n    distribution is not symmetrical.\n3.  The mean is usually used for normal distributed data.\n\n**Standard deviation**\n\n- You have to calculate the deviation in order to measure where your\n    data deviate from the normal value.\n\n### Statistics lesson 2.\n\nAs we have seen in previous lesson, statistics plays major roll to daily\nlife activities, therefor knowing how to apply statistics in analysis,\nis not only basic knowledge to acquire but also essential tool to\napproach and solve some analytic data based questions.\n\nSo in this lesson we shall focus on the second type of statistics, which\noften used to transform, analyze and give analytic results, to support\ndecision making. Inferential statistics help to solve many problems\nwhich require analytics approach, and scientific based evidence. So if\nyou want to become a data analyst or a good researcher, then this angle\nis where you should focus attentively.\n\n### Inferential Statistics for numeric data.\n\nWhile descriptive statistics used to describe type of data, and describe\nMedian, Mean, Mode and Range in a particular data. Then Inferential\nstatistics focus on solutions, or in other word, when Data rise\nchallenges or questions, it's inferential type of statistic which solve\nand answer those challenges and questions.\n\n### Data collection theory.\n\nBegin with sample collection, it is advise to collect at least 10 to 30\npercent samples of general population, this is to ensure samples can\nprovide accurate results. This is due to fact that, the less ample you\ncollect the less efficient result you may get, also the more sample you\ncollect might be unnecessary sometimes, this means it might not make any\ndifferent in results. So it is advice to collect a reasonable sample\nsize for better utilization of resources and time management.\n\n### Hypothesis Theory.\n\nHypothesis means the basic assumptions rouse by a researcher or a data\nannalist, which support or give reasons for Him/Her to conduct a\nresearch, or to collect a particular data to clear His/Her doubt. So\nevery researcher always have most common expected result in His/Her\nassumptions, But whatever results which are assumed to be true or false,\nare what called Hypothesis.\n\n::: callout\nThere are two types Hypothesis.\n\n1.  **Null Hypothesis -- Ho -- Negative.**\n2.  **Alternative Hypothesis -- Ha -- Positive**\n:::\n\nOften data are collected by researcher(s), who focus on a specific\nmatter or subject, So there are some steps to consider before going\nfield for data collection. Begin by setting your project plan, including\nproject tile and objectives, then finally to rise hypothesis. Now in\nprofessional standard, the Hypothesis which used to finalize the\nresearch conclusions is **Null Hypothesis -- Ho -- Negative.**\n\nIn statistic analysis, we use different approach to address solutions to\nour questions, A requires standard approach in statistical analysis, is\nto test the significance and Insignificance of the data results, and the\nnormality of data distributions. Therefor to be sure about data\nconclusions, then you have to **test data normality, and the\nsignificance and Insignificance of the results.**\n\n::: callout\n### Test significance and Insignificance.\n\n1.  Null hypothesis theory = No significant difference.\n2.  Alternative Hypothesis Theory = There is significant difference.\n:::\n\nNull hypothesis theory, is usually used to conclude results of the\nresearch, and to measure the significance of the results, as well as to\nmeasure the normality of data distributions, so many research\nconclusions are made by using this theory. So the significant level and\nNormality both are measured by P value.\n\n::: callout\n### Formula to measure significance of data results.\n\nIn the case of measuring significance of the results we refer to the\nformula that...\n\n-   when the P value = > 0.05 then it's considered There is No\n    significant difference. And\n-   when the P value = < 0.05 then it's considered There is significant\n    difference.\n:::\n\n### Test Normality Formula.\n\n1.  Null Hypothesis - Ho = Is normal distributed. while\n2.  Alternative Hypothesis - Ha = Is not normal distributed.\n\nNormality refers to the distribution of your collected data, this means\nafter you have describe your data in descriptive type of statistics,\nthen you have to test them, if they are normal distributed or not normal\ndistributed. In normality formula we prescribe the P level formula other\nway round, which means,\n\n::: callout\n### Normality formula.\n\nIn the case of measuring normality of data distributions we refer to the\nformula that...\n\n-   When P value = \\> 0.05 then you Accept the Null.\n-   When P value = \\< 0.05 then you Reject the Null.\n:::\n\n### Test Normality in R.\n\nIn R, we test the distributions of the data by using the function\n(shapiro), the below example is how you can test the distribution of the\ndata in R analysis. The data we are using is auto generated from R data\nbase. In R you can find some data to help you improve your analysis\npractice, in case you don't have access to acquire data from other\nsource. to generate data in R, just create a chunk then write iris then\nrun the chunk, and data will appear on your R editor. After that you can\nequate them to another name.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrequire(tidyverse)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nLoading required package: tidyverse\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n-- Attaching core tidyverse packages ------------------------ tidyverse 2.0.0 --\nv dplyr     1.1.0     v readr     2.1.4\nv forcats   1.0.0     v stringr   1.5.0\nv ggplot2   3.4.1     v tibble    3.1.8\nv lubridate 1.9.2     v tidyr     1.3.0\nv purrr     1.0.1     \n-- Conflicts ------------------------------------------ tidyverse_conflicts() --\nx dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\nx dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\ni Use the conflicted package (<http://conflicted.r-lib.org/>) to force all conflicts to become errors\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsample.iris=iris\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsample.iris$Sepal.Length %>%  shapiro.test()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\n\tShapiro-Wilk normality test\n\ndata:  .\nW = 0.97609, p-value = 0.01018\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = sample.iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length))+\n  geom_density(fill = \"darkred\",alpha = 0.3)+\n  theme_bw()+\n   theme(panel.grid.major.x = element_line(color = \"lightgrey\", linetype = \"dashed\"), panel.grid.major.y = element_line(color = \"lightgrey\", linetype = \"dashed\"), panel.grid = element_line(color = \"white\"), axis.title = element_text(color = \"darkred\", size = 12), axis.text = element_text(color = \"darkred\"), axis.line.x = element_line(linewidth = 1), axis.line.y = element_line(linewidth = 1))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nwe have tested Sepal.L data normality in R, and results shows that they\nare not normal distributed.

Then we have tried to plot in order to\nobserve visual distribution, and results still shows that Sepal.Width\nare normal distributed.\n\nThis is how we test data in R programming language, it is easier and\nclear as we have seen. S o working your data in R, is not only a\nrecommended tool but also facilitate mass data solutions.\n\n### CENTRAL LIMIT THEORY (CLT)\n\nIn statistics the central limit theory means the value on which majority\nof population falls. It simply states that The distribution approaches\nnormal, as the samples get larger. therefor it is recommended that to\nattain doubtless results you are required to collect at least \\>/= of\n30% samples of the population.\n\nThis theory of central limit usually shown through continuous plots such\nas Histogram and density. This is due to their nature. On the figure\nbelow we are going to see the example of central limit theory in\nvisualization.\n\nIn this study we will see how statistics works in real life, and how\nuseful it is in every day's decision making. By applying a proper and\ncorrect method in collecting/recording samples, analyzing, interpreting\nand sharing of findings is always a best way to reach the right\ndecisions, especially for decision makers, weather in family level.\n\n#### What is the purpose of dispersion\n\nThe purpose is to find out how spread out the data values are, on the\nnumber line, the deference between the maximum and the minimum value is\nthe formula to measure dispersion (Measure of spread).\n\n#### What does it mean by Measure of central tendency\n\nSimply is defined as A measure that identifies a single value as\nrepresentative of the entire distribution. It is the single value that\nis most typical/representative of the collected data.\n\n**Related pots**\n",
